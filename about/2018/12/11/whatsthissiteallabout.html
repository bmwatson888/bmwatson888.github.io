        <p>I’ve been an IT guy for two decades, and have two degrees in computer science related fields. During my time working as an “IT guy” and pursuing my education, I’ve always taken an interest in reading and telling stories.

<p>This site will be my white-board of writing ideas, short-stories, and maybe even a few novel length stories. I’m not sure what this will evolve to, but maybe one day this will be the seed that will grow into something larger than a simple blog.</p>

<p>I’ll admit, I’m not good at writing. Hopefully, over time, this site will help to change that. No one started out <strong>great</strong> at anything. Practice.</p>
