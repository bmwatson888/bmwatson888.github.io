<meta name="description" content="I awoke with a start, covered from head to toe in a cold sweat. My heaving chest began to slow and I sat up in the darkness. Did I have a nightmare? Whatever caused me to awake in such a panic was lost in the haze of consciousness. I couldn’t remember dreaming anything at all…let alone a nightmare.My head began to clear and my eyes adjusted to the darkness, allowing me to notice a small crack of light peeking through the curtains from across the room. It came back to me in a flash and I remembered where I was. I was in Las Vegas. To be specific, I was in my hotel room at the Tropicana.I suddenly became aware of the body next to me, my girlfriend Holly, whose long, deep breaths assured me that my sudden arousal had not woken her too. Since she was sleeping face down, I placed my hand on her back and felt the warmth of her body seep into my cold fingers. She began to slightly stir at the touch, so I pulled my hand away and slowly crept out of bed.I quietly walked over to the curtains and pulled them open just enough to poke my head through. The sudden intense sunlight stung my eyes and minutes seemed to pass before they were able to refocus. It had been quite a marathon of irresponsible alcohol consumption the night before and my eyes obviously hadn’t fully recovered.It was daytime in Vegas, the ugly half of the city’s facade, and our room’s 17th floor location facilitated quite a view of the city and the desert beyond. Thousands of people could be seen meandering about the strip below, but traffic on Las Vegas Blvd was surprisingly light. In fact, I couldn’t see any cars on the strip at all. Maybe they closed it down for an event?My mind soon wandered and my eyes fell upon a flashing electronic billboard hung above the entrance of the MGM Grand. The sign scrolled, “All-you-can-eat Fried Shrimp and Steak: $8.99”. My stomach rumbled…I could already taste the shrimp.I reclosed the curtain and stumbled back into the room. Fumbling through my suitcase in the darkness, I somehow managed to properly dress myself and put on my flip-flops. Grabbing my wallet and room key from the night stand, I momentarily considered waking Holly and asking her to join me for breakfast. The mental image of the two of us at breakfast was quickly replaced with the Patron shot glass pyramid she had built the night before and I smartly changed my mind. Maybe in a few hours.I hadn’t exactly escaped hangover free either; I wasn’t feeling sick, but a slightly throbbing headache reminded me that a hundred ounce fruity drink from Fat Tuesday’s costs more than the $30 they advertise it for.Deciding to stick with beer for the rest of the day, I grabbed a Heineken from my cooler. I didn’t normally drink first thing in the morning, but clichés of ‘hey I’m on vacation’, ‘this is Vegas baby’ and ‘drinking is the best cure for a hangover’ ran through my mind. I was always good at rationalizing a drunken stupor.I opened the door and headed down the hallway towards unlimited mounds of shrimp and steak.A few minutes and a short elevator ride away, I was on the casino floor. It only took a few steps out of the elevator for me to realize something wasn’t right. I could see plenty of people and the sounds of music and slot machines chimed through the casino. It wasn’t so much that something was out of place as the pace of everything was just off; as if the life has been drained from the casino. No one was cheering, no one was talking. There weren’t any kids hurrying past security guards or middle-aged women screaming into their cell phones. There were no drink waitresses working their way around the machines. In fact, no one was sitting at a machine at all. As if time were stopped, they were all just standing there.This all happened in a split second so my mind was reeling to make sense out of the scenario. What the hell was everyone doing? A moment later, I had the answer. What was the one thing every single individual on the casino floor had in common? They were all looking at me.In a dazed confusion I took a half step back. A short, elderly lady was only about 20 feet away from me and my attention snapped towards her as she began to move towards me. Her red shirt glistened in the light of the well-lit casino and something was hanging from her neck. As she took another step closer, I realized to my horror that her neck had been ripped open and a wad of flesh drooped from it. Her shirt wasn’t red, the sleeves were green; it was stained by the wave of blood that had erupted from her neck.I desperately looked around for help. A security guard stumbled around some machines, tripping and falling in front of the old woman. Torn flesh and damaged veins hung from the stump where his arm used to be, but the injury didn’t seem to bother him. He turned his head to look at me and stared at me for a moment with lifeless, glazed-over eyes. His nose wrinkled as if sniffing the air and he bared his teeth at me while emitting a horrible, guttural scream.My eyes began to tear with shock and I stumbled back into the closed elevator doors. The old woman tried to take another step, but the security guard had fallen in her path and she lost her balance, dropping on top of him. They each tried to climb each other in an attempt to get back on their feet, both of them, eyes intently on me.I again visually searched the casino for some shred of sanity, but there was no help there. Dozens of people slowly approached me, each with the same dead, glassy look in their eyes. Some were missing arms, some were simply bleeding profusely from wounds. One woman was missing both her legs and was managing to drag herself towards me by her arms.Like a rat trapped in a corner, I frantically searched for an escape route. Before I knew what I was doing, my hand painfully slapped the elevator button and the doors slowly pulled open. I darted inside and pushed the ‘17’ button as quickly as I possibly could. I frantically pummeled the ‘close doors’ button and looked back out towards the casino as the doors began to slowly shut. To my horror, the old woman had apparently managed to regain her footing and was close enough to stick her arm between the closing elevator doors. As soon as the doors detected the object, they swung back open, putting me face to face with an 80 year-old woman who was mashing her teeth.Using the only object I brought with me, the unopened Heineken bottle, I instinctively smashed the woman on the forehead, sending shards of broken glass and foamy beer across her face. Although a terrible waste of beer, the action had the desired effect, and the force sent the woman tumbling backwards. I repressed the ‘close door’ button and the last thing I saw as the doors slid shut was the woman again rising to her feet.I slumped to the floor as the sounds of Sinatra filled the elevator. The trip to the 17th floor felt like hours.I stumbled down the hallway in a frantic attempt to retreat to the safety of my hotel room. My hands were shaking so much it took several attempts to successfully aim the card key into the slot. With a click, the door unlocked and I forced my way into the darkened room, slamming the heavy door shut behind me and locking the deadbolt.Sprinting across the room to the window, I grabbed the curtains and threw them open, filling the room with blinding sunlight. I nearly jumped through window when an angry voice growled from under the covers of the bed, “What the fuck, Kev!?”“Holly, get up,” the sense of urgency was clear in my tone.“Close the blinds and give me a minute,” she begged, too hungover to really care what I was in such a hurry for.“Holly, get up now,” I said sternly while pulling the covers off the bed. “Something fucked-up is going on right now. Get dressed.”She curled her naked body into the fetal position and finally lifted her head to look at me, “Assho…” Her anger instantly subsided when she saw the look on my face. That look told her to get the hell out of bed and get dressed. “What’s going on?”“I was just attacked in the casino. An old lady was bleeding from her neck and I think she was trying to bite me. I smashed my Heineken over her head…”“You did what!?!” she yelled as she pulled her shirt on over her head.“It wasn’t just her…a security guard was missing his arm…everyone in the casino had this weird look in their eyes,” I said, stuttering.“What the fuck are you talking about?” She pulled on her jeans and walked over to the window, “Christ, you hit an old woman…”We both stopped talking as we witnessed the spectacle unfolding on the Las Vegas strip below. A police car raced down the strip, swerving in and out of pedestrians who apparently weren’t restricting themselves to the sidewalk. As the car passed through the Tropicana Blvd intersection, several dozen people flung themselves from the overhead walkway and down onto the street. The officer swerved to avoid the falling bodies, jumped the curb and hit the streetlight head-on with his car. Swirls of smoke poured out from under the hood.Holly gasped at the sight of the collision, but relaxed when the officer opened his door and stumbled out onto the street. Several of the bridge jumpers had risen to their feet and began to slowly make their way towards the officer. Bystanders surrounding the collision also noticed the commotion and also began approaching the scene.We could see the officer yelling something, then he pulled his revolver and began randomly shooting anyone around him. “What the hell is he doing,” Holly cried as a woman took a shot to the head and crumbled to the pavement.We couldn’t hear the shots through the closed hotel window, but we assumed he was out of ammunition when he hurled his gun at the crowd. He had only managed to drop the woman, and his barrage did little to effect the crowd’s determination to reach him. The officer fell to his knees as two men grabbed each of his arms…and ripped them from his body. He fell on his face in a heap as the crowd pounced on top of him.Holly took several steps backward from the window, her eyes wet with tears. She looked at me for some kind of an explanation, but all I could do was turn away from her and look back out the window.“Kev…what the fuck is going on…did they just kill that cop? Why are people jumping from bridges…why did he shoot those people…” She burst into tears and I grabbed her in my arms.“I don’t know,” I said, “but I think we need to get the fuck out of here.”After a few minutes, Holly calmed down and I sat on the edge of the bed, racking my brain. There was no way in hell I was going back down to that casino, but as far as I knew, that was the only way back to the ground floor. We wouldn’t have anywhere to go anyway…the valet had our car and keys, and somehow I doubted there was anyone working the valet at that moment.Holly grabbed the hotel room phone and put the receiver to her ear. She hit a few buttons on the keypad and slammed the phone back in place, “It’s dead. My cell phone!”She grabbed her purse from the nightstand and dumped its contents onto the bed. As she flipped open her phone, I used the remote to turn on the TV.“It’s no use…I have service, but it just keeps coming up busy.”“Holly,” I said, calmly.“Maybe a text message will work…”“Holly,” I said, firmly this time. She turned at looked at the TV as I flipped from channel to channel, seeing nothing but static. “We have to get the fuck out of here.”We both frantically searched our bags for anything we could use in a survival situation. I generally preferred to pack light, so other than several fresh changes of clothes, the only other items in my suitcase were a flask, a lighter, a cigar cutter and my four-inch pocket knife, all of which I jammed into my jean’s pockets. Holly, on the other hand, packed practically two weeks of necessities, in two bags, for a mere weekend trip. Unfortunately her dedication to ‘being prepared’ was useless, since having an outfit for any occasion wouldn’t do much against a rabid mob. The only potentially useful item we found was a can of mace from her purse, which she pocketed.“Keep trying the cell phone,” I knew where I was headed, I just wasn’t sure what I was going to do once I got there. “Maybe we’ll get a better signal from the roof.”As we cautiously exited the hotel room, Holly turned left to head toward the elevators.“Uh-uh,” I signaled her in my direction as I turned to the right, “I think I’ll take the stairs this time.”Removing my knife from its pocket and opening the blade, I led Holly down the hallway. There were doors on both sides, so I fully expected a bloodthirsty mob to jump out of each one we passed. The hallway was eerily quiet and I got the feeling that we were the only people still on the floor.The last door at the end of the hallway had an icon of a staircase painted on it, and I paused as I put my hand on the push bar.“What’s wrong?” Holly inquired upon my hesitation.“I’m just trying to decide if opening this door is such a great idea.”“It can’t be any worse than hanging out here in this exposed hallway,” Holly rationalized.“Good point,” I said as I pushed the door open, baring the pocket knife ahead of me.The stairwell was well-lit and in good condition, but more importantly, it was empty. I wasn’t sure how far it was to the top of the hotel, but I knew from see the hotel outside, that it was at least twenty stories tall. Luckily, our room was already on the 17th.Holly closed the door behind her as she entered the stairwell and we both paused for a long moment to listen. Off in the distance we could hear loud thumping and banging. The noises were definitely originating at least several floors below us, but we decided against going down to investigate. We couldn’t hear anything from above our position, so we started to climb.The staircase leading to the 23rd floor dead-ended at a shut door with sunlight trickling around the edges. Along the push bar of the door was labeled ‘Authorized Personnel Only’, but at this point neither of us were worried about violating hotel policy. I opened the door a crack and peeked through, allowing my eyes to adjust to the sunlight. It was August in the desert, and I could feel the stifling heat pouring through the crack and into the air-conditioned stairwell.“What’s out there?” Holly asked, trying to look past me.From this vantage point, I could only see a small portion of the roof, but everything seemed quiet and undisturbed, so I pushed the door open the rest of the way. It swung wide and we both stepped out onto the gravel covered rooftop.As soon as Holly could get past me, she ran over to the ledge closest to the strip. I cautiously followed after her while surveying the roof for any sign of movement. After deciding the roof was clear, I put my knife back in its pocket and joined Holly at the ledge.“Look, the cop is gone,” Holly said, pointing at the blood stained asphalt where he fell. “Where did he go?”I glanced around the street, but didn’t see him anywhere. There’s no way he could have walked away with those injuries. The street was still filled with those insane people, so it’s unlikely an ambulance would have been able to get to him without meeting the same fate.I suddenly blurted out the only possibility I couldn’t eliminate, “Maybe they ate him?”Holly snapped her head back and gave me a look as if she couldn’t believe what had just come out of my mouth. Holly’s brother was a police officer back in California, so I think she took my comment personally. Her eyes welled up and she looked back down at the street, ashamed to admit she was thinking the same thing herself.I put my arm over her shoulder and visually scanned the area surrounding the hotel. The Excalibur, the castle themed hotel across the street, was on fire and smoke was pouring out of broken windows on several floors. The streets were still full of wandering pedestrians and I could now see quite a few abandoned cars further down the strip. McCarran airport was right behind us and was void of activity; highly unusual for one of the highest volume airports on the planet. Something horrible had happened here.I could also hear screaming in the distance, but I couldn’t tell where it was coming from.Despite the obvious disaster that had befallen the city, Las Vegas still appeared to be in pretty good shape. Electricity was still functioning properly on almost every casino, and, aside from the smoldering Excalibur, everything appeared normal.It was the eerie silence that was getting to me. Vegas was always a town hopped up on alcohol, drugs, sex and excitement. Seeing it like this was like looking at it in a painting or a photo. Sure, it looks exactly the same, but you can’t feel the life or energy of actually being in the middle of it. Well, I was certainly in the middle of it and the only life I felt was the one standing next to me on the ledge of the Tropicana’s roof.A metallic bang startled both of us and we looked back at the roof. The stairwell door slowly swung back and forth in the breeze.“It’s ok,” I told Holly who was visibly rattled, “it was just the wind.”A blood stained arm reached out of the shadowed stairwell opening and grabbed the edge of the doorway. A bald, middle aged man with glasses poked his head outside and lazily looked around the roof top. His glasses were askew on his face and his white t-shirt was stained red with blood. He froze when he noticed the two of us standing next to the ledge.I pulled my knife out and flipped open the blade. We had carelessly left the rooftop door open, giving these monsters full access to our only area of safety. I knew I had to get that door closed before more could make their way through.Knife in hand, I ran at the man, who growled and mashed his teeth as I approached. When I was close enough to strike, the man grabbed a hold of my free forearm and squeezed it painfully. I reactively brought the knife down into the top of his skull.His grip on my arm relaxed and he stood there for a moment, as if confused. He then collapsed backward under his own weight, the knife still in his head, and tumbled down the stairwell. On his way down to the next floor, his limp body impacted a group of other blood soaked individuals who were making their way up the stairs. I slammed the rooftop door shut and desperately searched for a way to bar it.Unfortunately, the rooftop door had no outer locking mechanism and could easily be opened by a firm push on the door.“Here!” Holly shouted, handing me a section of metal cable she had pulled from the ground. I wrapped the door handle with the cable and tied it to a thick, steel pipe that ran vertically, just around the corner of the rooftop doorway. I looped it around a few extra times, just to make sure it wouldn’t come loose. As I finished, a force impacted the door. The cable held as the monster inside desperately tried to beat down the door.After a few minutes, the beating stopped and we decided it must have given up.“How’s your arm?” Holly asked, reminding me the intense grip the monster had on my arm. There were no cuts or bleeding, but a nasty bruise did seem eminent.“Oh god, your other arm is bleeding,” Holly gasped.I examined my right arm. It was completely uninjured, but quite a bit of my attacker’s blood had smeared onto me during the knife assault.“No, it’s ok…it’s not my blood,” I said as I wiped as much as I could off with my shirt.“Are you sure you’re ok? That guy looked like he wanted to bite your head off.”“Yeah, I’m fine,” I assured her, “I’d say he got the worse end of the deal. Anyway, I’m more concerned that we might have just lost our only way off this rooftop.”“No, I’m pretty sure I saw another stairwell on the far side of the roof,” Holly said, pointing in the distance to another boxy structure emerging from the ground.“We should go tie that one off too or get the hell off of this roof before it’s too late,” She finished, grabbing another length of cable from the remnants left on the ground.Not sure which we should do, we began walking towards the other stairwell. Should we dehydrate to death on this roof, under the intense heat of the sun or should we risk getting mauled to death by the occupants of the hotel? Neither seemed a promising choice.As we approached the second stairwell door, it burst open, and five people stumbled into the sunlight.“Holy shit, I thought I was going to suffocate in that damn thing,” complained a large, portly man wearing a poker themed shirt.“We should be able to…freeze!” the second man, in the uniform of a security guard, interrupted himself as he saw us, raising a pistol. As he did so, the other three members of his group, three women in their twenties, screamed and ran back into the stairwell.We both froze in place with our hands up in front of us. We were more relieved to see normal, talking human beings than fearful of having a gun pointed at us.“Hang on man, we’re not one of them,” I said, dropping my hands. “We thought we were the only normal people left.”The security guard relaxed, dropped his pistol and announced, “It’s ok, they’re just more survivors.”The young women emerged from the doorway and cautiously evaluated us from behind the security guard. One of them had an interesting hat, like a mini-bridal veil, on her head and I assumed they must be in town for a wedding.“I’m Kevin and this is my girlfriend, Holly,” I said, extending my arm for a hand shake.“The name’s Martin,” the security guard said, grasping my hand. When he glanced down and noticed the remaining blood on my arm he alarmingly pulled his arm back and re-aimed his weapon. “Where have you been bitten?!”“It’s not a bite,” I responded, nervously, “I stabbed one of those creatures over at the other stairwell and got his blood all over me.”Martin lowered the gun and roughly grabbed my arm, carefully inspecting the area for any injuries. Holly had enough, “What the fuck is your problem? Why are you so worried about a bite anyway?”Martin, apparently satisfied that I wasn’t injured, holstered his gun and answered Holly, “If one of those things bites you, you eventually turn into one of them.”“That was back when there were six of us,” chimed in the man wearing the poker shirt.The security guard finished the story for him, “An old man was bitten by his wife and found us down on ten. He was in pretty bad shape. He lasted for about twenty minutes before he finally turned.”“What are these things?” Holly asked.Martin shook his head, “I don’t know, but we have to get out of the city. Bullets don’t even put these things down unless you shoot them in the head. Wil here thinks it’s some kind of virus.”“What else could it be?” said Wil, the man in the poker shirt. “It’s like some kind of brain eating form of rabies or something.”The three women standing behind Martin were still visibly shaking. Despite the sweltering heat of the rooftop, they were huddled next to each other as if trying to get warm. It didn’t seem like any of them had taken this disaster very well.One of them finally managed to gather enough courage to yell, “How are we going to get out of here!”“I’m working on it,” Martin replied, as if annoyed. He leaned closer to Holly and myself and whispered, “I haven’t been able to get any of their names, so far. They’ve kind of just been following me since I shot my way out of the casino.”He nodded towards Holly, “Maybe she can talk to them…”Holly accepted and sat the three women against the ledge wall, while Martin, Wil and I secured the stairwell door and discussed our situation. Wil had been in town for a poker tournament at the Rio, but busted out on the first day. His flight was scheduled to leave later tonight and return to San Diego, where he worked in IT consulting. Martin was a Las Vegas resident and the afternoon security manager for the Tropicana. His wife had recently kicked him out of the house, so he had been staying at the hotel. He woke that morning, ready for work, and walked into the same disaster Holly and I had.“It took me half a clip,” Martin explained, “before I finally dropped one with a head shot. After that I could bring them down in one shot every time. Had to take out half my department just trying to get back to the elevator.”Hours passed and we made little progress towards a plan on getting us out of the city. The sun has started to set behind the mountains and everyone was getting hungry.The sun had finally set behind the mountain, but Las Vegas wasn’t a city that dulled at night. Whatever disaster that had befallen the city apparently had no effect on the power grid, as neon and LED lights brightened the strip. Even most of the lights on the Excalibur, which was still smoking from various fires, were lit.The group sat quietly on the rooftop, unsure of what move to make next.“So are we going to wait here for help?” said Wil, breaking the silence. “Or are we going to try to get ourselves out of the city. The airport isn’t very far…”“Do you know how to fly?” asked Martin, the obvious question.“No,” replied Wil, “but I think I’d still prefer a plane crash to getting eaten alive.”It wasn’t intended as a joke, but Martin and I couldn’t help bursting out in laughter. Holly, noticing the mood was starting to lighten, waived me over to meet her at the edge of the roof that was out of earshot of the rest of the group.“So what’s going on?” she asked.“Wil’s idea is to make a break for the airport and take our chances trying to fly out of here. He hasn’t said so, but I get the feeling Martin wants to wait here for help and I’m inclined to agree. Considering what I’ve seen so far, I don’t know how we’d have a chance of making it to McCarran.”After a pause, I asked, “What’s with the girls?”“It took me awhile, but they’ve finally calmed down,” Holly explained, “I guess the three of them are from California, too. Sheri, the one with the bridal hat, is getting married next week and the three of them drove out here for a bachelorette trip. I think it’s a safe bet that they’ll follow whatever the group wants to do.”“How’s your arm?” Holly added.“Sore, but I’ll survive,” I said with a smile.“Please do,” she replied, warmly.A few minutes later the group met back up near the strip side of the rooftop. Wil was pretty adamant about his plan to make it to the airport, but quickly changed his mind when Martin showed him the two remaining rounds left in his pistol. We were all in agreement that we’d need more than two bullets to make it to McCarran.“We have an armory down in the security offices,” Martin explained, “but I was barely able to get out of there the last time. There’s enough rifles, shotguns and riot gear down there for a small army, if we could get to it.”“That’s it,” Wil said, excitedly. “We’ll go down, get the guns and fight our way to the airport.”“It sounds risky,” I said to Martin, “but I’d say it’s the best plan we have. There isn’t any food or water up here and it’s the middle of summer. We won’t last more than a few more days up here.”Martin seemed to come around, “Alright, but we’re going to need to come up with something to get into those offices. I’m telling you, the place was crawling with those fuckers.”The girls seemed nervous about the plan, but everyone eventually agreed that there was no other reasonable option. We decided to make the attempt first thing in the morning after everyone had a chance to rest.…The peaceful silence of the early morning was broken by the sound of approaching aircraft. The noise jolted me from an uneasy sleep and I wiped the gravel from my clothing as I stood. Martin was already awake and standing at the rooftop ledge, looking into the distance towards the sound.“It’s a military chopper,” he said calmly as he heard me approach. “It’s sweeping the city like it’s looking for something.”In the distance, a black helicopter slowly made its way, back and forth, over the city. The rest of the group had awakened and joined us at the ledge. The three girls from the bachelorette party fruitlessly waived their arms in the air, trying to get the chopper’s attention. No one had the heart to tell them they were much too far away to be noticed.“He’s been making his way towards the center of the city all morning,” said Martin, “he should be right over us within an hour.”“Thank god,” said one of the three women who all began to excitedly hug each other.I looked over at Wil, “Looks like you won’t be earning your pilot’s license today.”Wil nodded and smiled back. He didn’t look disappointed.…Just as the sun cleared the edge of the eastern mountains, the helicopter began to make its way down the northern end of the strip. As it approached us, we could hear the sound of a muffled loud speaker booming down the corridor created by the hotels. It was almost right above us before we could understand the message it was broadcasting:“Attention survivors: please rendezvous with rescuers at the rooftop of the Bellagio. The Bellagio has the only rooftop helicopter pad in the city. We will not land at any other point. Make your way to the Bellagio rooftop within 72 hours for airlift rescue.”The message continuously repeated as the chopper flew past us and continued down the strip.Martin pulled his pistol from its holster, loaded a bullet into the chamber and said, “Alright everyone, let’s move.”To be continued…">

  <meta property="og:description" content="I awoke with a start, covered from head to toe in a cold sweat. My heaving chest began to slow and I sat up in the darkness. Did I have a nightmare? Whatever caused me to awake in such a panic was lost in the haze of consciousness. I couldn’t remember dreaming anything at all…let alone a nightmare.My head began to clear and my eyes adjusted to the darkness, allowing me to notice a small crack of light peeking through the curtains from across the room. It came back to me in a flash and I remembered where I was. I was in Las Vegas. To be specific, I was in my hotel room at the Tropicana.I suddenly became aware of the body next to me, my girlfriend Holly, whose long, deep breaths assured me that my sudden arousal had not woken her too. Since she was sleeping face down, I placed my hand on her back and felt the warmth of her body seep into my cold fingers. She began to slightly stir at the touch, so I pulled my hand away and slowly crept out of bed.I quietly walked over to the curtains and pulled them open just enough to poke my head through. The sudden intense sunlight stung my eyes and minutes seemed to pass before they were able to refocus. It had been quite a marathon of irresponsible alcohol consumption the night before and my eyes obviously hadn’t fully recovered.It was daytime in Vegas, the ugly half of the city’s facade, and our room’s 17th floor location facilitated quite a view of the city and the desert beyond. Thousands of people could be seen meandering about the strip below, but traffic on Las Vegas Blvd was surprisingly light. In fact, I couldn’t see any cars on the strip at all. Maybe they closed it down for an event?My mind soon wandered and my eyes fell upon a flashing electronic billboard hung above the entrance of the MGM Grand. The sign scrolled, “All-you-can-eat Fried Shrimp and Steak: $8.99”. My stomach rumbled…I could already taste the shrimp.I reclosed the curtain and stumbled back into the room. Fumbling through my suitcase in the darkness, I somehow managed to properly dress myself and put on my flip-flops. Grabbing my wallet and room key from the night stand, I momentarily considered waking Holly and asking her to join me for breakfast. The mental image of the two of us at breakfast was quickly replaced with the Patron shot glass pyramid she had built the night before and I smartly changed my mind. Maybe in a few hours.I hadn’t exactly escaped hangover free either; I wasn’t feeling sick, but a slightly throbbing headache reminded me that a hundred ounce fruity drink from Fat Tuesday’s costs more than the $30 they advertise it for.Deciding to stick with beer for the rest of the day, I grabbed a Heineken from my cooler. I didn’t normally drink first thing in the morning, but clichés of ‘hey I’m on vacation’, ‘this is Vegas baby’ and ‘drinking is the best cure for a hangover’ ran through my mind. I was always good at rationalizing a drunken stupor.I opened the door and headed down the hallway towards unlimited mounds of shrimp and steak.A few minutes and a short elevator ride away, I was on the casino floor. It only took a few steps out of the elevator for me to realize something wasn’t right. I could see plenty of people and the sounds of music and slot machines chimed through the casino. It wasn’t so much that something was out of place as the pace of everything was just off; as if the life has been drained from the casino. No one was cheering, no one was talking. There weren’t any kids hurrying past security guards or middle-aged women screaming into their cell phones. There were no drink waitresses working their way around the machines. In fact, no one was sitting at a machine at all. As if time were stopped, they were all just standing there.This all happened in a split second so my mind was reeling to make sense out of the scenario. What the hell was everyone doing? A moment later, I had the answer. What was the one thing every single individual on the casino floor had in common? They were all looking at me.In a dazed confusion I took a half step back. A short, elderly lady was only about 20 feet away from me and my attention snapped towards her as she began to move towards me. Her red shirt glistened in the light of the well-lit casino and something was hanging from her neck. As she took another step closer, I realized to my horror that her neck had been ripped open and a wad of flesh drooped from it. Her shirt wasn’t red, the sleeves were green; it was stained by the wave of blood that had erupted from her neck.I desperately looked around for help. A security guard stumbled around some machines, tripping and falling in front of the old woman. Torn flesh and damaged veins hung from the stump where his arm used to be, but the injury didn’t seem to bother him. He turned his head to look at me and stared at me for a moment with lifeless, glazed-over eyes. His nose wrinkled as if sniffing the air and he bared his teeth at me while emitting a horrible, guttural scream.My eyes began to tear with shock and I stumbled back into the closed elevator doors. The old woman tried to take another step, but the security guard had fallen in her path and she lost her balance, dropping on top of him. They each tried to climb each other in an attempt to get back on their feet, both of them, eyes intently on me.I again visually searched the casino for some shred of sanity, but there was no help there. Dozens of people slowly approached me, each with the same dead, glassy look in their eyes. Some were missing arms, some were simply bleeding profusely from wounds. One woman was missing both her legs and was managing to drag herself towards me by her arms.Like a rat trapped in a corner, I frantically searched for an escape route. Before I knew what I was doing, my hand painfully slapped the elevator button and the doors slowly pulled open. I darted inside and pushed the ‘17’ button as quickly as I possibly could. I frantically pummeled the ‘close doors’ button and looked back out towards the casino as the doors began to slowly shut. To my horror, the old woman had apparently managed to regain her footing and was close enough to stick her arm between the closing elevator doors. As soon as the doors detected the object, they swung back open, putting me face to face with an 80 year-old woman who was mashing her teeth.Using the only object I brought with me, the unopened Heineken bottle, I instinctively smashed the woman on the forehead, sending shards of broken glass and foamy beer across her face. Although a terrible waste of beer, the action had the desired effect, and the force sent the woman tumbling backwards. I repressed the ‘close door’ button and the last thing I saw as the doors slid shut was the woman again rising to her feet.I slumped to the floor as the sounds of Sinatra filled the elevator. The trip to the 17th floor felt like hours.I stumbled down the hallway in a frantic attempt to retreat to the safety of my hotel room. My hands were shaking so much it took several attempts to successfully aim the card key into the slot. With a click, the door unlocked and I forced my way into the darkened room, slamming the heavy door shut behind me and locking the deadbolt.Sprinting across the room to the window, I grabbed the curtains and threw them open, filling the room with blinding sunlight. I nearly jumped through window when an angry voice growled from under the covers of the bed, “What the fuck, Kev!?”“Holly, get up,” the sense of urgency was clear in my tone.“Close the blinds and give me a minute,” she begged, too hungover to really care what I was in such a hurry for.“Holly, get up now,” I said sternly while pulling the covers off the bed. “Something fucked-up is going on right now. Get dressed.”She curled her naked body into the fetal position and finally lifted her head to look at me, “Assho…” Her anger instantly subsided when she saw the look on my face. That look told her to get the hell out of bed and get dressed. “What’s going on?”“I was just attacked in the casino. An old lady was bleeding from her neck and I think she was trying to bite me. I smashed my Heineken over her head…”“You did what!?!” she yelled as she pulled her shirt on over her head.“It wasn’t just her…a security guard was missing his arm…everyone in the casino had this weird look in their eyes,” I said, stuttering.“What the fuck are you talking about?” She pulled on her jeans and walked over to the window, “Christ, you hit an old woman…”We both stopped talking as we witnessed the spectacle unfolding on the Las Vegas strip below. A police car raced down the strip, swerving in and out of pedestrians who apparently weren’t restricting themselves to the sidewalk. As the car passed through the Tropicana Blvd intersection, several dozen people flung themselves from the overhead walkway and down onto the street. The officer swerved to avoid the falling bodies, jumped the curb and hit the streetlight head-on with his car. Swirls of smoke poured out from under the hood.Holly gasped at the sight of the collision, but relaxed when the officer opened his door and stumbled out onto the street. Several of the bridge jumpers had risen to their feet and began to slowly make their way towards the officer. Bystanders surrounding the collision also noticed the commotion and also began approaching the scene.We could see the officer yelling something, then he pulled his revolver and began randomly shooting anyone around him. “What the hell is he doing,” Holly cried as a woman took a shot to the head and crumbled to the pavement.We couldn’t hear the shots through the closed hotel window, but we assumed he was out of ammunition when he hurled his gun at the crowd. He had only managed to drop the woman, and his barrage did little to effect the crowd’s determination to reach him. The officer fell to his knees as two men grabbed each of his arms…and ripped them from his body. He fell on his face in a heap as the crowd pounced on top of him.Holly took several steps backward from the window, her eyes wet with tears. She looked at me for some kind of an explanation, but all I could do was turn away from her and look back out the window.“Kev…what the fuck is going on…did they just kill that cop? Why are people jumping from bridges…why did he shoot those people…” She burst into tears and I grabbed her in my arms.“I don’t know,” I said, “but I think we need to get the fuck out of here.”After a few minutes, Holly calmed down and I sat on the edge of the bed, racking my brain. There was no way in hell I was going back down to that casino, but as far as I knew, that was the only way back to the ground floor. We wouldn’t have anywhere to go anyway…the valet had our car and keys, and somehow I doubted there was anyone working the valet at that moment.Holly grabbed the hotel room phone and put the receiver to her ear. She hit a few buttons on the keypad and slammed the phone back in place, “It’s dead. My cell phone!”She grabbed her purse from the nightstand and dumped its contents onto the bed. As she flipped open her phone, I used the remote to turn on the TV.“It’s no use…I have service, but it just keeps coming up busy.”“Holly,” I said, calmly.“Maybe a text message will work…”“Holly,” I said, firmly this time. She turned at looked at the TV as I flipped from channel to channel, seeing nothing but static. “We have to get the fuck out of here.”We both frantically searched our bags for anything we could use in a survival situation. I generally preferred to pack light, so other than several fresh changes of clothes, the only other items in my suitcase were a flask, a lighter, a cigar cutter and my four-inch pocket knife, all of which I jammed into my jean’s pockets. Holly, on the other hand, packed practically two weeks of necessities, in two bags, for a mere weekend trip. Unfortunately her dedication to ‘being prepared’ was useless, since having an outfit for any occasion wouldn’t do much against a rabid mob. The only potentially useful item we found was a can of mace from her purse, which she pocketed.“Keep trying the cell phone,” I knew where I was headed, I just wasn’t sure what I was going to do once I got there. “Maybe we’ll get a better signal from the roof.”As we cautiously exited the hotel room, Holly turned left to head toward the elevators.“Uh-uh,” I signaled her in my direction as I turned to the right, “I think I’ll take the stairs this time.”Removing my knife from its pocket and opening the blade, I led Holly down the hallway. There were doors on both sides, so I fully expected a bloodthirsty mob to jump out of each one we passed. The hallway was eerily quiet and I got the feeling that we were the only people still on the floor.The last door at the end of the hallway had an icon of a staircase painted on it, and I paused as I put my hand on the push bar.“What’s wrong?” Holly inquired upon my hesitation.“I’m just trying to decide if opening this door is such a great idea.”“It can’t be any worse than hanging out here in this exposed hallway,” Holly rationalized.“Good point,” I said as I pushed the door open, baring the pocket knife ahead of me.The stairwell was well-lit and in good condition, but more importantly, it was empty. I wasn’t sure how far it was to the top of the hotel, but I knew from see the hotel outside, that it was at least twenty stories tall. Luckily, our room was already on the 17th.Holly closed the door behind her as she entered the stairwell and we both paused for a long moment to listen. Off in the distance we could hear loud thumping and banging. The noises were definitely originating at least several floors below us, but we decided against going down to investigate. We couldn’t hear anything from above our position, so we started to climb.The staircase leading to the 23rd floor dead-ended at a shut door with sunlight trickling around the edges. Along the push bar of the door was labeled ‘Authorized Personnel Only’, but at this point neither of us were worried about violating hotel policy. I opened the door a crack and peeked through, allowing my eyes to adjust to the sunlight. It was August in the desert, and I could feel the stifling heat pouring through the crack and into the air-conditioned stairwell.“What’s out there?” Holly asked, trying to look past me.From this vantage point, I could only see a small portion of the roof, but everything seemed quiet and undisturbed, so I pushed the door open the rest of the way. It swung wide and we both stepped out onto the gravel covered rooftop.As soon as Holly could get past me, she ran over to the ledge closest to the strip. I cautiously followed after her while surveying the roof for any sign of movement. After deciding the roof was clear, I put my knife back in its pocket and joined Holly at the ledge.“Look, the cop is gone,” Holly said, pointing at the blood stained asphalt where he fell. “Where did he go?”I glanced around the street, but didn’t see him anywhere. There’s no way he could have walked away with those injuries. The street was still filled with those insane people, so it’s unlikely an ambulance would have been able to get to him without meeting the same fate.I suddenly blurted out the only possibility I couldn’t eliminate, “Maybe they ate him?”Holly snapped her head back and gave me a look as if she couldn’t believe what had just come out of my mouth. Holly’s brother was a police officer back in California, so I think she took my comment personally. Her eyes welled up and she looked back down at the street, ashamed to admit she was thinking the same thing herself.I put my arm over her shoulder and visually scanned the area surrounding the hotel. The Excalibur, the castle themed hotel across the street, was on fire and smoke was pouring out of broken windows on several floors. The streets were still full of wandering pedestrians and I could now see quite a few abandoned cars further down the strip. McCarran airport was right behind us and was void of activity; highly unusual for one of the highest volume airports on the planet. Something horrible had happened here.I could also hear screaming in the distance, but I couldn’t tell where it was coming from.Despite the obvious disaster that had befallen the city, Las Vegas still appeared to be in pretty good shape. Electricity was still functioning properly on almost every casino, and, aside from the smoldering Excalibur, everything appeared normal.It was the eerie silence that was getting to me. Vegas was always a town hopped up on alcohol, drugs, sex and excitement. Seeing it like this was like looking at it in a painting or a photo. Sure, it looks exactly the same, but you can’t feel the life or energy of actually being in the middle of it. Well, I was certainly in the middle of it and the only life I felt was the one standing next to me on the ledge of the Tropicana’s roof.A metallic bang startled both of us and we looked back at the roof. The stairwell door slowly swung back and forth in the breeze.“It’s ok,” I told Holly who was visibly rattled, “it was just the wind.”A blood stained arm reached out of the shadowed stairwell opening and grabbed the edge of the doorway. A bald, middle aged man with glasses poked his head outside and lazily looked around the roof top. His glasses were askew on his face and his white t-shirt was stained red with blood. He froze when he noticed the two of us standing next to the ledge.I pulled my knife out and flipped open the blade. We had carelessly left the rooftop door open, giving these monsters full access to our only area of safety. I knew I had to get that door closed before more could make their way through.Knife in hand, I ran at the man, who growled and mashed his teeth as I approached. When I was close enough to strike, the man grabbed a hold of my free forearm and squeezed it painfully. I reactively brought the knife down into the top of his skull.His grip on my arm relaxed and he stood there for a moment, as if confused. He then collapsed backward under his own weight, the knife still in his head, and tumbled down the stairwell. On his way down to the next floor, his limp body impacted a group of other blood soaked individuals who were making their way up the stairs. I slammed the rooftop door shut and desperately searched for a way to bar it.Unfortunately, the rooftop door had no outer locking mechanism and could easily be opened by a firm push on the door.“Here!” Holly shouted, handing me a section of metal cable she had pulled from the ground. I wrapped the door handle with the cable and tied it to a thick, steel pipe that ran vertically, just around the corner of the rooftop doorway. I looped it around a few extra times, just to make sure it wouldn’t come loose. As I finished, a force impacted the door. The cable held as the monster inside desperately tried to beat down the door.After a few minutes, the beating stopped and we decided it must have given up.“How’s your arm?” Holly asked, reminding me the intense grip the monster had on my arm. There were no cuts or bleeding, but a nasty bruise did seem eminent.“Oh god, your other arm is bleeding,” Holly gasped.I examined my right arm. It was completely uninjured, but quite a bit of my attacker’s blood had smeared onto me during the knife assault.“No, it’s ok…it’s not my blood,” I said as I wiped as much as I could off with my shirt.“Are you sure you’re ok? That guy looked like he wanted to bite your head off.”“Yeah, I’m fine,” I assured her, “I’d say he got the worse end of the deal. Anyway, I’m more concerned that we might have just lost our only way off this rooftop.”“No, I’m pretty sure I saw another stairwell on the far side of the roof,” Holly said, pointing in the distance to another boxy structure emerging from the ground.“We should go tie that one off too or get the hell off of this roof before it’s too late,” She finished, grabbing another length of cable from the remnants left on the ground.Not sure which we should do, we began walking towards the other stairwell. Should we dehydrate to death on this roof, under the intense heat of the sun or should we risk getting mauled to death by the occupants of the hotel? Neither seemed a promising choice.As we approached the second stairwell door, it burst open, and five people stumbled into the sunlight.“Holy shit, I thought I was going to suffocate in that damn thing,” complained a large, portly man wearing a poker themed shirt.“We should be able to…freeze!” the second man, in the uniform of a security guard, interrupted himself as he saw us, raising a pistol. As he did so, the other three members of his group, three women in their twenties, screamed and ran back into the stairwell.We both froze in place with our hands up in front of us. We were more relieved to see normal, talking human beings than fearful of having a gun pointed at us.“Hang on man, we’re not one of them,” I said, dropping my hands. “We thought we were the only normal people left.”The security guard relaxed, dropped his pistol and announced, “It’s ok, they’re just more survivors.”The young women emerged from the doorway and cautiously evaluated us from behind the security guard. One of them had an interesting hat, like a mini-bridal veil, on her head and I assumed they must be in town for a wedding.“I’m Kevin and this is my girlfriend, Holly,” I said, extending my arm for a hand shake.“The name’s Martin,” the security guard said, grasping my hand. When he glanced down and noticed the remaining blood on my arm he alarmingly pulled his arm back and re-aimed his weapon. “Where have you been bitten?!”“It’s not a bite,” I responded, nervously, “I stabbed one of those creatures over at the other stairwell and got his blood all over me.”Martin lowered the gun and roughly grabbed my arm, carefully inspecting the area for any injuries. Holly had enough, “What the fuck is your problem? Why are you so worried about a bite anyway?”Martin, apparently satisfied that I wasn’t injured, holstered his gun and answered Holly, “If one of those things bites you, you eventually turn into one of them.”“That was back when there were six of us,” chimed in the man wearing the poker shirt.The security guard finished the story for him, “An old man was bitten by his wife and found us down on ten. He was in pretty bad shape. He lasted for about twenty minutes before he finally turned.”“What are these things?” Holly asked.Martin shook his head, “I don’t know, but we have to get out of the city. Bullets don’t even put these things down unless you shoot them in the head. Wil here thinks it’s some kind of virus.”“What else could it be?” said Wil, the man in the poker shirt. “It’s like some kind of brain eating form of rabies or something.”The three women standing behind Martin were still visibly shaking. Despite the sweltering heat of the rooftop, they were huddled next to each other as if trying to get warm. It didn’t seem like any of them had taken this disaster very well.One of them finally managed to gather enough courage to yell, “How are we going to get out of here!”“I’m working on it,” Martin replied, as if annoyed. He leaned closer to Holly and myself and whispered, “I haven’t been able to get any of their names, so far. They’ve kind of just been following me since I shot my way out of the casino.”He nodded towards Holly, “Maybe she can talk to them…”Holly accepted and sat the three women against the ledge wall, while Martin, Wil and I secured the stairwell door and discussed our situation. Wil had been in town for a poker tournament at the Rio, but busted out on the first day. His flight was scheduled to leave later tonight and return to San Diego, where he worked in IT consulting. Martin was a Las Vegas resident and the afternoon security manager for the Tropicana. His wife had recently kicked him out of the house, so he had been staying at the hotel. He woke that morning, ready for work, and walked into the same disaster Holly and I had.“It took me half a clip,” Martin explained, “before I finally dropped one with a head shot. After that I could bring them down in one shot every time. Had to take out half my department just trying to get back to the elevator.”Hours passed and we made little progress towards a plan on getting us out of the city. The sun has started to set behind the mountains and everyone was getting hungry.The sun had finally set behind the mountain, but Las Vegas wasn’t a city that dulled at night. Whatever disaster that had befallen the city apparently had no effect on the power grid, as neon and LED lights brightened the strip. Even most of the lights on the Excalibur, which was still smoking from various fires, were lit.The group sat quietly on the rooftop, unsure of what move to make next.“So are we going to wait here for help?” said Wil, breaking the silence. “Or are we going to try to get ourselves out of the city. The airport isn’t very far…”“Do you know how to fly?” asked Martin, the obvious question.“No,” replied Wil, “but I think I’d still prefer a plane crash to getting eaten alive.”It wasn’t intended as a joke, but Martin and I couldn’t help bursting out in laughter. Holly, noticing the mood was starting to lighten, waived me over to meet her at the edge of the roof that was out of earshot of the rest of the group.“So what’s going on?” she asked.“Wil’s idea is to make a break for the airport and take our chances trying to fly out of here. He hasn’t said so, but I get the feeling Martin wants to wait here for help and I’m inclined to agree. Considering what I’ve seen so far, I don’t know how we’d have a chance of making it to McCarran.”After a pause, I asked, “What’s with the girls?”“It took me awhile, but they’ve finally calmed down,” Holly explained, “I guess the three of them are from California, too. Sheri, the one with the bridal hat, is getting married next week and the three of them drove out here for a bachelorette trip. I think it’s a safe bet that they’ll follow whatever the group wants to do.”“How’s your arm?” Holly added.“Sore, but I’ll survive,” I said with a smile.“Please do,” she replied, warmly.A few minutes later the group met back up near the strip side of the rooftop. Wil was pretty adamant about his plan to make it to the airport, but quickly changed his mind when Martin showed him the two remaining rounds left in his pistol. We were all in agreement that we’d need more than two bullets to make it to McCarran.“We have an armory down in the security offices,” Martin explained, “but I was barely able to get out of there the last time. There’s enough rifles, shotguns and riot gear down there for a small army, if we could get to it.”“That’s it,” Wil said, excitedly. “We’ll go down, get the guns and fight our way to the airport.”“It sounds risky,” I said to Martin, “but I’d say it’s the best plan we have. There isn’t any food or water up here and it’s the middle of summer. We won’t last more than a few more days up here.”Martin seemed to come around, “Alright, but we’re going to need to come up with something to get into those offices. I’m telling you, the place was crawling with those fuckers.”The girls seemed nervous about the plan, but everyone eventually agreed that there was no other reasonable option. We decided to make the attempt first thing in the morning after everyone had a chance to rest.…The peaceful silence of the early morning was broken by the sound of approaching aircraft. The noise jolted me from an uneasy sleep and I wiped the gravel from my clothing as I stood. Martin was already awake and standing at the rooftop ledge, looking into the distance towards the sound.“It’s a military chopper,” he said calmly as he heard me approach. “It’s sweeping the city like it’s looking for something.”In the distance, a black helicopter slowly made its way, back and forth, over the city. The rest of the group had awakened and joined us at the ledge. The three girls from the bachelorette party fruitlessly waived their arms in the air, trying to get the chopper’s attention. No one had the heart to tell them they were much too far away to be noticed.“He’s been making his way towards the center of the city all morning,” said Martin, “he should be right over us within an hour.”“Thank god,” said one of the three women who all began to excitedly hug each other.I looked over at Wil, “Looks like you won’t be earning your pilot’s license today.”Wil nodded and smiled back. He didn’t look disappointed.…Just as the sun cleared the edge of the eastern mountains, the helicopter began to make its way down the northern end of the strip. As it approached us, we could hear the sound of a muffled loud speaker booming down the corridor created by the hotels. It was almost right above us before we could understand the message it was broadcasting:“Attention survivors: please rendezvous with rescuers at the rooftop of the Bellagio. The Bellagio has the only rooftop helicopter pad in the city. We will not land at any other point. Make your way to the Bellagio rooftop within 72 hours for airlift rescue.”The message continuously repeated as the chopper flew past us and continued down the strip.Martin pulled his pistol from its holster, loaded a bullet into the chamber and said, “Alright everyone, let’s move.”To be continued…">

    <meta itemprop="headline" content="Loathing Las Vegas - Part 1">
    <meta itemprop="description" content="I awoke with a start, covered from head to toe in a cold sweat. My heaving chest began to slow and I sat up in the darkness. Did I have a nightmare? Whatever caused me to awake in such a panic was lost in the haze of consciousness. I couldn’t remember dreaming anything at all…let alone a nightmare.My head began to clear and my eyes adjusted to the darkness, allowing me to notice a small crack of light peeking through the curtains from across the room. It came back to me in a flash and I remembered where I was. I was in Las Vegas. To be specific, I was in my hotel room at the Tropicana.I suddenly became aware of the body next to me, my girlfriend Holly, whose long, deep breaths assured me that my sudden arousal had not woken her too. Since she was sleeping face down, I placed my hand on her back and felt the warmth of her body seep into my cold fingers. She began to slightly stir at the touch, so I pulled my hand away and slowly crept out of bed.I quietly walked over to the curtains and pulled them open just enough to poke my head through. The sudden intense sunlight stung my eyes and minutes seemed to pass before they were able to refocus. It had been quite a marathon of irresponsible alcohol consumption the night before and my eyes obviously hadn’t fully recovered.It was daytime in Vegas, the ugly half of the city’s facade, and our room’s 17th floor location facilitated quite a view of the city and the desert beyond. Thousands of people could be seen meandering about the strip below, but traffic on Las Vegas Blvd was surprisingly light. In fact, I couldn’t see any cars on the strip at all. Maybe they closed it down for an event?My mind soon wandered and my eyes fell upon a flashing electronic billboard hung above the entrance of the MGM Grand. The sign scrolled, “All-you-can-eat Fried Shrimp and Steak: $8.99”. My stomach rumbled…I could already taste the shrimp.I reclosed the curtain and stumbled back into the room. Fumbling through my suitcase in the darkness, I somehow managed to properly dress myself and put on my flip-flops. Grabbing my wallet and room key from the night stand, I momentarily considered waking Holly and asking her to join me for breakfast. The mental image of the two of us at breakfast was quickly replaced with the Patron shot glass pyramid she had built the night before and I smartly changed my mind. Maybe in a few hours.I hadn’t exactly escaped hangover free either; I wasn’t feeling sick, but a slightly throbbing headache reminded me that a hundred ounce fruity drink from Fat Tuesday’s costs more than the $30 they advertise it for.Deciding to stick with beer for the rest of the day, I grabbed a Heineken from my cooler. I didn’t normally drink first thing in the morning, but clichés of ‘hey I’m on vacation’, ‘this is Vegas baby’ and ‘drinking is the best cure for a hangover’ ran through my mind. I was always good at rationalizing a drunken stupor.I opened the door and headed down the hallway towards unlimited mounds of shrimp and steak.A few minutes and a short elevator ride away, I was on the casino floor. It only took a few steps out of the elevator for me to realize something wasn’t right. I could see plenty of people and the sounds of music and slot machines chimed through the casino. It wasn’t so much that something was out of place as the pace of everything was just off; as if the life has been drained from the casino. No one was cheering, no one was talking. There weren’t any kids hurrying past security guards or middle-aged women screaming into their cell phones. There were no drink waitresses working their way around the machines. In fact, no one was sitting at a machine at all. As if time were stopped, they were all just standing there.This all happened in a split second so my mind was reeling to make sense out of the scenario. What the hell was everyone doing? A moment later, I had the answer. What was the one thing every single individual on the casino floor had in common? They were all looking at me.In a dazed confusion I took a half step back. A short, elderly lady was only about 20 feet away from me and my attention snapped towards her as she began to move towards me. Her red shirt glistened in the light of the well-lit casino and something was hanging from her neck. As she took another step closer, I realized to my horror that her neck had been ripped open and a wad of flesh drooped from it. Her shirt wasn’t red, the sleeves were green; it was stained by the wave of blood that had erupted from her neck.I desperately looked around for help. A security guard stumbled around some machines, tripping and falling in front of the old woman. Torn flesh and damaged veins hung from the stump where his arm used to be, but the injury didn’t seem to bother him. He turned his head to look at me and stared at me for a moment with lifeless, glazed-over eyes. His nose wrinkled as if sniffing the air and he bared his teeth at me while emitting a horrible, guttural scream.My eyes began to tear with shock and I stumbled back into the closed elevator doors. The old woman tried to take another step, but the security guard had fallen in her path and she lost her balance, dropping on top of him. They each tried to climb each other in an attempt to get back on their feet, both of them, eyes intently on me.I again visually searched the casino for some shred of sanity, but there was no help there. Dozens of people slowly approached me, each with the same dead, glassy look in their eyes. Some were missing arms, some were simply bleeding profusely from wounds. One woman was missing both her legs and was managing to drag herself towards me by her arms.Like a rat trapped in a corner, I frantically searched for an escape route. Before I knew what I was doing, my hand painfully slapped the elevator button and the doors slowly pulled open. I darted inside and pushed the ‘17’ button as quickly as I possibly could. I frantically pummeled the ‘close doors’ button and looked back out towards the casino as the doors began to slowly shut. To my horror, the old woman had apparently managed to regain her footing and was close enough to stick her arm between the closing elevator doors. As soon as the doors detected the object, they swung back open, putting me face to face with an 80 year-old woman who was mashing her teeth.Using the only object I brought with me, the unopened Heineken bottle, I instinctively smashed the woman on the forehead, sending shards of broken glass and foamy beer across her face. Although a terrible waste of beer, the action had the desired effect, and the force sent the woman tumbling backwards. I repressed the ‘close door’ button and the last thing I saw as the doors slid shut was the woman again rising to her feet.I slumped to the floor as the sounds of Sinatra filled the elevator. The trip to the 17th floor felt like hours.I stumbled down the hallway in a frantic attempt to retreat to the safety of my hotel room. My hands were shaking so much it took several attempts to successfully aim the card key into the slot. With a click, the door unlocked and I forced my way into the darkened room, slamming the heavy door shut behind me and locking the deadbolt.Sprinting across the room to the window, I grabbed the curtains and threw them open, filling the room with blinding sunlight. I nearly jumped through window when an angry voice growled from under the covers of the bed, “What the fuck, Kev!?”“Holly, get up,” the sense of urgency was clear in my tone.“Close the blinds and give me a minute,” she begged, too hungover to really care what I was in such a hurry for.“Holly, get up now,” I said sternly while pulling the covers off the bed. “Something fucked-up is going on right now. Get dressed.”She curled her naked body into the fetal position and finally lifted her head to look at me, “Assho…” Her anger instantly subsided when she saw the look on my face. That look told her to get the hell out of bed and get dressed. “What’s going on?”“I was just attacked in the casino. An old lady was bleeding from her neck and I think she was trying to bite me. I smashed my Heineken over her head…”“You did what!?!” she yelled as she pulled her shirt on over her head.“It wasn’t just her…a security guard was missing his arm…everyone in the casino had this weird look in their eyes,” I said, stuttering.“What the fuck are you talking about?” She pulled on her jeans and walked over to the window, “Christ, you hit an old woman…”We both stopped talking as we witnessed the spectacle unfolding on the Las Vegas strip below. A police car raced down the strip, swerving in and out of pedestrians who apparently weren’t restricting themselves to the sidewalk. As the car passed through the Tropicana Blvd intersection, several dozen people flung themselves from the overhead walkway and down onto the street. The officer swerved to avoid the falling bodies, jumped the curb and hit the streetlight head-on with his car. Swirls of smoke poured out from under the hood.Holly gasped at the sight of the collision, but relaxed when the officer opened his door and stumbled out onto the street. Several of the bridge jumpers had risen to their feet and began to slowly make their way towards the officer. Bystanders surrounding the collision also noticed the commotion and also began approaching the scene.We could see the officer yelling something, then he pulled his revolver and began randomly shooting anyone around him. “What the hell is he doing,” Holly cried as a woman took a shot to the head and crumbled to the pavement.We couldn’t hear the shots through the closed hotel window, but we assumed he was out of ammunition when he hurled his gun at the crowd. He had only managed to drop the woman, and his barrage did little to effect the crowd’s determination to reach him. The officer fell to his knees as two men grabbed each of his arms…and ripped them from his body. He fell on his face in a heap as the crowd pounced on top of him.Holly took several steps backward from the window, her eyes wet with tears. She looked at me for some kind of an explanation, but all I could do was turn away from her and look back out the window.“Kev…what the fuck is going on…did they just kill that cop? Why are people jumping from bridges…why did he shoot those people…” She burst into tears and I grabbed her in my arms.“I don’t know,” I said, “but I think we need to get the fuck out of here.”After a few minutes, Holly calmed down and I sat on the edge of the bed, racking my brain. There was no way in hell I was going back down to that casino, but as far as I knew, that was the only way back to the ground floor. We wouldn’t have anywhere to go anyway…the valet had our car and keys, and somehow I doubted there was anyone working the valet at that moment.Holly grabbed the hotel room phone and put the receiver to her ear. She hit a few buttons on the keypad and slammed the phone back in place, “It’s dead. My cell phone!”She grabbed her purse from the nightstand and dumped its contents onto the bed. As she flipped open her phone, I used the remote to turn on the TV.“It’s no use…I have service, but it just keeps coming up busy.”“Holly,” I said, calmly.“Maybe a text message will work…”“Holly,” I said, firmly this time. She turned at looked at the TV as I flipped from channel to channel, seeing nothing but static. “We have to get the fuck out of here.”We both frantically searched our bags for anything we could use in a survival situation. I generally preferred to pack light, so other than several fresh changes of clothes, the only other items in my suitcase were a flask, a lighter, a cigar cutter and my four-inch pocket knife, all of which I jammed into my jean’s pockets. Holly, on the other hand, packed practically two weeks of necessities, in two bags, for a mere weekend trip. Unfortunately her dedication to ‘being prepared’ was useless, since having an outfit for any occasion wouldn’t do much against a rabid mob. The only potentially useful item we found was a can of mace from her purse, which she pocketed.“Keep trying the cell phone,” I knew where I was headed, I just wasn’t sure what I was going to do once I got there. “Maybe we’ll get a better signal from the roof.”As we cautiously exited the hotel room, Holly turned left to head toward the elevators.“Uh-uh,” I signaled her in my direction as I turned to the right, “I think I’ll take the stairs this time.”Removing my knife from its pocket and opening the blade, I led Holly down the hallway. There were doors on both sides, so I fully expected a bloodthirsty mob to jump out of each one we passed. The hallway was eerily quiet and I got the feeling that we were the only people still on the floor.The last door at the end of the hallway had an icon of a staircase painted on it, and I paused as I put my hand on the push bar.“What’s wrong?” Holly inquired upon my hesitation.“I’m just trying to decide if opening this door is such a great idea.”“It can’t be any worse than hanging out here in this exposed hallway,” Holly rationalized.“Good point,” I said as I pushed the door open, baring the pocket knife ahead of me.The stairwell was well-lit and in good condition, but more importantly, it was empty. I wasn’t sure how far it was to the top of the hotel, but I knew from see the hotel outside, that it was at least twenty stories tall. Luckily, our room was already on the 17th.Holly closed the door behind her as she entered the stairwell and we both paused for a long moment to listen. Off in the distance we could hear loud thumping and banging. The noises were definitely originating at least several floors below us, but we decided against going down to investigate. We couldn’t hear anything from above our position, so we started to climb.The staircase leading to the 23rd floor dead-ended at a shut door with sunlight trickling around the edges. Along the push bar of the door was labeled ‘Authorized Personnel Only’, but at this point neither of us were worried about violating hotel policy. I opened the door a crack and peeked through, allowing my eyes to adjust to the sunlight. It was August in the desert, and I could feel the stifling heat pouring through the crack and into the air-conditioned stairwell.“What’s out there?” Holly asked, trying to look past me.From this vantage point, I could only see a small portion of the roof, but everything seemed quiet and undisturbed, so I pushed the door open the rest of the way. It swung wide and we both stepped out onto the gravel covered rooftop.As soon as Holly could get past me, she ran over to the ledge closest to the strip. I cautiously followed after her while surveying the roof for any sign of movement. After deciding the roof was clear, I put my knife back in its pocket and joined Holly at the ledge.“Look, the cop is gone,” Holly said, pointing at the blood stained asphalt where he fell. “Where did he go?”I glanced around the street, but didn’t see him anywhere. There’s no way he could have walked away with those injuries. The street was still filled with those insane people, so it’s unlikely an ambulance would have been able to get to him without meeting the same fate.I suddenly blurted out the only possibility I couldn’t eliminate, “Maybe they ate him?”Holly snapped her head back and gave me a look as if she couldn’t believe what had just come out of my mouth. Holly’s brother was a police officer back in California, so I think she took my comment personally. Her eyes welled up and she looked back down at the street, ashamed to admit she was thinking the same thing herself.I put my arm over her shoulder and visually scanned the area surrounding the hotel. The Excalibur, the castle themed hotel across the street, was on fire and smoke was pouring out of broken windows on several floors. The streets were still full of wandering pedestrians and I could now see quite a few abandoned cars further down the strip. McCarran airport was right behind us and was void of activity; highly unusual for one of the highest volume airports on the planet. Something horrible had happened here.I could also hear screaming in the distance, but I couldn’t tell where it was coming from.Despite the obvious disaster that had befallen the city, Las Vegas still appeared to be in pretty good shape. Electricity was still functioning properly on almost every casino, and, aside from the smoldering Excalibur, everything appeared normal.It was the eerie silence that was getting to me. Vegas was always a town hopped up on alcohol, drugs, sex and excitement. Seeing it like this was like looking at it in a painting or a photo. Sure, it looks exactly the same, but you can’t feel the life or energy of actually being in the middle of it. Well, I was certainly in the middle of it and the only life I felt was the one standing next to me on the ledge of the Tropicana’s roof.A metallic bang startled both of us and we looked back at the roof. The stairwell door slowly swung back and forth in the breeze.“It’s ok,” I told Holly who was visibly rattled, “it was just the wind.”A blood stained arm reached out of the shadowed stairwell opening and grabbed the edge of the doorway. A bald, middle aged man with glasses poked his head outside and lazily looked around the roof top. His glasses were askew on his face and his white t-shirt was stained red with blood. He froze when he noticed the two of us standing next to the ledge.I pulled my knife out and flipped open the blade. We had carelessly left the rooftop door open, giving these monsters full access to our only area of safety. I knew I had to get that door closed before more could make their way through.Knife in hand, I ran at the man, who growled and mashed his teeth as I approached. When I was close enough to strike, the man grabbed a hold of my free forearm and squeezed it painfully. I reactively brought the knife down into the top of his skull.His grip on my arm relaxed and he stood there for a moment, as if confused. He then collapsed backward under his own weight, the knife still in his head, and tumbled down the stairwell. On his way down to the next floor, his limp body impacted a group of other blood soaked individuals who were making their way up the stairs. I slammed the rooftop door shut and desperately searched for a way to bar it.Unfortunately, the rooftop door had no outer locking mechanism and could easily be opened by a firm push on the door.“Here!” Holly shouted, handing me a section of metal cable she had pulled from the ground. I wrapped the door handle with the cable and tied it to a thick, steel pipe that ran vertically, just around the corner of the rooftop doorway. I looped it around a few extra times, just to make sure it wouldn’t come loose. As I finished, a force impacted the door. The cable held as the monster inside desperately tried to beat down the door.After a few minutes, the beating stopped and we decided it must have given up.“How’s your arm?” Holly asked, reminding me the intense grip the monster had on my arm. There were no cuts or bleeding, but a nasty bruise did seem eminent.“Oh god, your other arm is bleeding,” Holly gasped.I examined my right arm. It was completely uninjured, but quite a bit of my attacker’s blood had smeared onto me during the knife assault.“No, it’s ok…it’s not my blood,” I said as I wiped as much as I could off with my shirt.“Are you sure you’re ok? That guy looked like he wanted to bite your head off.”“Yeah, I’m fine,” I assured her, “I’d say he got the worse end of the deal. Anyway, I’m more concerned that we might have just lost our only way off this rooftop.”“No, I’m pretty sure I saw another stairwell on the far side of the roof,” Holly said, pointing in the distance to another boxy structure emerging from the ground.“We should go tie that one off too or get the hell off of this roof before it’s too late,” She finished, grabbing another length of cable from the remnants left on the ground.Not sure which we should do, we began walking towards the other stairwell. Should we dehydrate to death on this roof, under the intense heat of the sun or should we risk getting mauled to death by the occupants of the hotel? Neither seemed a promising choice.As we approached the second stairwell door, it burst open, and five people stumbled into the sunlight.“Holy shit, I thought I was going to suffocate in that damn thing,” complained a large, portly man wearing a poker themed shirt.“We should be able to…freeze!” the second man, in the uniform of a security guard, interrupted himself as he saw us, raising a pistol. As he did so, the other three members of his group, three women in their twenties, screamed and ran back into the stairwell.We both froze in place with our hands up in front of us. We were more relieved to see normal, talking human beings than fearful of having a gun pointed at us.“Hang on man, we’re not one of them,” I said, dropping my hands. “We thought we were the only normal people left.”The security guard relaxed, dropped his pistol and announced, “It’s ok, they’re just more survivors.”The young women emerged from the doorway and cautiously evaluated us from behind the security guard. One of them had an interesting hat, like a mini-bridal veil, on her head and I assumed they must be in town for a wedding.“I’m Kevin and this is my girlfriend, Holly,” I said, extending my arm for a hand shake.“The name’s Martin,” the security guard said, grasping my hand. When he glanced down and noticed the remaining blood on my arm he alarmingly pulled his arm back and re-aimed his weapon. “Where have you been bitten?!”“It’s not a bite,” I responded, nervously, “I stabbed one of those creatures over at the other stairwell and got his blood all over me.”Martin lowered the gun and roughly grabbed my arm, carefully inspecting the area for any injuries. Holly had enough, “What the fuck is your problem? Why are you so worried about a bite anyway?”Martin, apparently satisfied that I wasn’t injured, holstered his gun and answered Holly, “If one of those things bites you, you eventually turn into one of them.”“That was back when there were six of us,” chimed in the man wearing the poker shirt.The security guard finished the story for him, “An old man was bitten by his wife and found us down on ten. He was in pretty bad shape. He lasted for about twenty minutes before he finally turned.”“What are these things?” Holly asked.Martin shook his head, “I don’t know, but we have to get out of the city. Bullets don’t even put these things down unless you shoot them in the head. Wil here thinks it’s some kind of virus.”“What else could it be?” said Wil, the man in the poker shirt. “It’s like some kind of brain eating form of rabies or something.”The three women standing behind Martin were still visibly shaking. Despite the sweltering heat of the rooftop, they were huddled next to each other as if trying to get warm. It didn’t seem like any of them had taken this disaster very well.One of them finally managed to gather enough courage to yell, “How are we going to get out of here!”“I’m working on it,” Martin replied, as if annoyed. He leaned closer to Holly and myself and whispered, “I haven’t been able to get any of their names, so far. They’ve kind of just been following me since I shot my way out of the casino.”He nodded towards Holly, “Maybe she can talk to them…”Holly accepted and sat the three women against the ledge wall, while Martin, Wil and I secured the stairwell door and discussed our situation. Wil had been in town for a poker tournament at the Rio, but busted out on the first day. His flight was scheduled to leave later tonight and return to San Diego, where he worked in IT consulting. Martin was a Las Vegas resident and the afternoon security manager for the Tropicana. His wife had recently kicked him out of the house, so he had been staying at the hotel. He woke that morning, ready for work, and walked into the same disaster Holly and I had.“It took me half a clip,” Martin explained, “before I finally dropped one with a head shot. After that I could bring them down in one shot every time. Had to take out half my department just trying to get back to the elevator.”Hours passed and we made little progress towards a plan on getting us out of the city. The sun has started to set behind the mountains and everyone was getting hungry.The sun had finally set behind the mountain, but Las Vegas wasn’t a city that dulled at night. Whatever disaster that had befallen the city apparently had no effect on the power grid, as neon and LED lights brightened the strip. Even most of the lights on the Excalibur, which was still smoking from various fires, were lit.The group sat quietly on the rooftop, unsure of what move to make next.“So are we going to wait here for help?” said Wil, breaking the silence. “Or are we going to try to get ourselves out of the city. The airport isn’t very far…”“Do you know how to fly?” asked Martin, the obvious question.“No,” replied Wil, “but I think I’d still prefer a plane crash to getting eaten alive.”It wasn’t intended as a joke, but Martin and I couldn’t help bursting out in laughter. Holly, noticing the mood was starting to lighten, waived me over to meet her at the edge of the roof that was out of earshot of the rest of the group.“So what’s going on?” she asked.“Wil’s idea is to make a break for the airport and take our chances trying to fly out of here. He hasn’t said so, but I get the feeling Martin wants to wait here for help and I’m inclined to agree. Considering what I’ve seen so far, I don’t know how we’d have a chance of making it to McCarran.”After a pause, I asked, “What’s with the girls?”“It took me awhile, but they’ve finally calmed down,” Holly explained, “I guess the three of them are from California, too. Sheri, the one with the bridal hat, is getting married next week and the three of them drove out here for a bachelorette trip. I think it’s a safe bet that they’ll follow whatever the group wants to do.”“How’s your arm?” Holly added.“Sore, but I’ll survive,” I said with a smile.“Please do,” she replied, warmly.A few minutes later the group met back up near the strip side of the rooftop. Wil was pretty adamant about his plan to make it to the airport, but quickly changed his mind when Martin showed him the two remaining rounds left in his pistol. We were all in agreement that we’d need more than two bullets to make it to McCarran.“We have an armory down in the security offices,” Martin explained, “but I was barely able to get out of there the last time. There’s enough rifles, shotguns and riot gear down there for a small army, if we could get to it.”“That’s it,” Wil said, excitedly. “We’ll go down, get the guns and fight our way to the airport.”“It sounds risky,” I said to Martin, “but I’d say it’s the best plan we have. There isn’t any food or water up here and it’s the middle of summer. We won’t last more than a few more days up here.”Martin seemed to come around, “Alright, but we’re going to need to come up with something to get into those offices. I’m telling you, the place was crawling with those fuckers.”The girls seemed nervous about the plan, but everyone eventually agreed that there was no other reasonable option. We decided to make the attempt first thing in the morning after everyone had a chance to rest.…The peaceful silence of the early morning was broken by the sound of approaching aircraft. The noise jolted me from an uneasy sleep and I wiped the gravel from my clothing as I stood. Martin was already awake and standing at the rooftop ledge, looking into the distance towards the sound.“It’s a military chopper,” he said calmly as he heard me approach. “It’s sweeping the city like it’s looking for something.”In the distance, a black helicopter slowly made its way, back and forth, over the city. The rest of the group had awakened and joined us at the ledge. The three girls from the bachelorette party fruitlessly waived their arms in the air, trying to get the chopper’s attention. No one had the heart to tell them they were much too far away to be noticed.“He’s been making his way towards the center of the city all morning,” said Martin, “he should be right over us within an hour.”“Thank god,” said one of the three women who all began to excitedly hug each other.I looked over at Wil, “Looks like you won’t be earning your pilot’s license today.”Wil nodded and smiled back. He didn’t look disappointed.…Just as the sun cleared the edge of the eastern mountains, the helicopter began to make its way down the northern end of the strip. As it approached us, we could hear the sound of a muffled loud speaker booming down the corridor created by the hotels. It was almost right above us before we could understand the message it was broadcasting:“Attention survivors: please rendezvous with rescuers at the rooftop of the Bellagio. The Bellagio has the only rooftop helicopter pad in the city. We will not land at any other point. Make your way to the Bellagio rooftop within 72 hours for airlift rescue.”The message continuously repeated as the chopper flew past us and continued down the strip.Martin pulled his pistol from its holster, loaded a bullet into the chamber and said, “Alright everyone, let’s move.”To be continued…">

      <section class="page__content" itemprop="text">
        
        <p>I awoke with a start, covered from head to toe in a cold sweat. My heaving chest began to slow and I sat up in the darkness. Did I have a nightmare? Whatever caused me to awake in such a panic was lost in the haze of consciousness. I couldn’t remember dreaming anything at all…let alone a nightmare.</p>

<p>My head began to clear and my eyes adjusted to the darkness, allowing me to notice a small crack of light peeking through the curtains from across the room. It came back to me in a flash and I remembered where I was. I was in Las Vegas. To be specific, I was in my hotel room at the Tropicana.</p>

<p>I suddenly became aware of the body next to me, my girlfriend Holly, whose long, deep breaths assured me that my sudden arousal had not woken her too. Since she was sleeping face down, I placed my hand on her back and felt the warmth of her body seep into my cold fingers. She began to slightly stir at the touch, so I pulled my hand away and slowly crept out of bed.</p>

<p>I quietly walked over to the curtains and pulled them open just enough to poke my head through. The sudden intense sunlight stung my eyes and minutes seemed to pass before they were able to refocus. It had been quite a marathon of irresponsible alcohol consumption the night before and my eyes obviously hadn’t fully recovered.</p>

<p>It was daytime in Vegas, the ugly half of the city’s facade, and our room’s 17th floor location facilitated quite a view of the city and the desert beyond. Thousands of people could be seen meandering about the strip below, but traffic on Las Vegas Blvd was surprisingly light. In fact, I couldn’t see any cars on the strip at all. Maybe they closed it down for an event?</p>

<p>My mind soon wandered and my eyes fell upon a flashing electronic billboard hung above the entrance of the MGM Grand. The sign scrolled, “All-you-can-eat Fried Shrimp and Steak: $8.99”. My stomach rumbled…I could already taste the shrimp.</p>

<p>I reclosed the curtain and stumbled back into the room. Fumbling through my suitcase in the darkness, I somehow managed to properly dress myself and put on my flip-flops. Grabbing my wallet and room key from the night stand, I momentarily considered waking Holly and asking her to join me for breakfast. The mental image of the two of us at breakfast was quickly replaced with the Patron shot glass pyramid she had built the night before and I smartly changed my mind. Maybe in a few hours.</p>

<p>I hadn’t exactly escaped hangover free either; I wasn’t feeling sick, but a slightly throbbing headache reminded me that a hundred ounce fruity drink from Fat Tuesday’s costs more than the $30 they advertise it for.</p>

<p>Deciding to stick with beer for the rest of the day, I grabbed a Heineken from my cooler. I didn’t normally drink first thing in the morning, but clichés of ‘hey I’m on vacation’, ‘this is Vegas baby’ and ‘drinking is the best cure for a hangover’ ran through my mind. I was always good at rationalizing a drunken stupor.</p>

<p>I opened the door and headed down the hallway towards unlimited mounds of shrimp and steak.</p>

<p>A few minutes and a short elevator ride away, I was on the casino floor. It only took a few steps out of the elevator for me to realize something wasn’t right. I could see plenty of people and the sounds of music and slot machines chimed through the casino. It wasn’t so much that something was out of place as the pace of everything was just off; as if the life has been drained from the casino. No one was cheering, no one was talking. There weren’t any kids hurrying past security guards or middle-aged women screaming into their cell phones. There were no drink waitresses working their way around the machines. In fact, no one was sitting at a machine at all. As if time were stopped, they were all just standing there.</p>

<p>This all happened in a split second so my mind was reeling to make sense out of the scenario. What the hell was everyone doing? A moment later, I had the answer. What was the one thing every single individual on the casino floor had in common? They were all looking at me.</p>

<p>In a dazed confusion I took a half step back. A short, elderly lady was only about 20 feet away from me and my attention snapped towards her as she began to move towards me. Her red shirt glistened in the light of the well-lit casino and something was hanging from her neck. As she took another step closer, I realized to my horror that her neck had been ripped open and a wad of flesh drooped from it. Her shirt wasn’t red, the sleeves were green; it was stained by the wave of blood that had erupted from her neck.</p>

<p>I desperately looked around for help. A security guard stumbled around some machines, tripping and falling in front of the old woman. Torn flesh and damaged veins hung from the stump where his arm used to be, but the injury didn’t seem to bother him. He turned his head to look at me and stared at me for a moment with lifeless, glazed-over eyes. His nose wrinkled as if sniffing the air and he bared his teeth at me while emitting a horrible, guttural scream.</p>

<p>My eyes began to tear with shock and I stumbled back into the closed elevator doors. The old woman tried to take another step, but the security guard had fallen in her path and she lost her balance, dropping on top of him. They each tried to climb each other in an attempt to get back on their feet, both of them, eyes intently on me.</p>

<p>I again visually searched the casino for some shred of sanity, but there was no help there. Dozens of people slowly approached me, each with the same dead, glassy look in their eyes. Some were missing arms, some were simply bleeding profusely from wounds. One woman was missing both her legs and was managing to drag herself towards me by her arms.</p>

<p>Like a rat trapped in a corner, I frantically searched for an escape route. Before I knew what I was doing, my hand painfully slapped the elevator button and the doors slowly pulled open. I darted inside and pushed the ‘17’ button as quickly as I possibly could. I frantically pummeled the ‘close doors’ button and looked back out towards the casino as the doors began to slowly shut. To my horror, the old woman had apparently managed to regain her footing and was close enough to stick her arm between the closing elevator doors. As soon as the doors detected the object, they swung back open, putting me face to face with an 80 year-old woman who was mashing her teeth.</p>

<p>Using the only object I brought with me, the unopened Heineken bottle, I instinctively smashed the woman on the forehead, sending shards of broken glass and foamy beer across her face. Although a terrible waste of beer, the action had the desired effect, and the force sent the woman tumbling backwards. I repressed the ‘close door’ button and the last thing I saw as the doors slid shut was the woman again rising to her feet.</p>

<p>I slumped to the floor as the sounds of Sinatra filled the elevator. The trip to the 17th floor felt like hours.</p>

<p>I stumbled down the hallway in a frantic attempt to retreat to the safety of my hotel room. My hands were shaking so much it took several attempts to successfully aim the card key into the slot. With a click, the door unlocked and I forced my way into the darkened room, slamming the heavy door shut behind me and locking the deadbolt.</p>

<p>Sprinting across the room to the window, I grabbed the curtains and threw them open, filling the room with blinding sunlight. I nearly jumped through window when an angry voice growled from under the covers of the bed, “What the fuck, Kev!?”</p>

<p>“Holly, get up,” the sense of urgency was clear in my tone.</p>

<p>“Close the blinds and give me a minute,” she begged, too hungover to really care what I was in such a hurry for.</p>

<p>“Holly, get up now,” I said sternly while pulling the covers off the bed. “Something fucked-up is going on right now. Get dressed.”</p>

<p>She curled her naked body into the fetal position and finally lifted her head to look at me, “Assho…” Her anger instantly subsided when she saw the look on my face. That look told her to get the hell out of bed and get dressed. “What’s going on?”</p>

<p>“I was just attacked in the casino. An old lady was bleeding from her neck and I think she was trying to bite me. I smashed my Heineken over her head…”</p>

<p>“You did what!?!” she yelled as she pulled her shirt on over her head.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t just her…a security guard was missing his arm…everyone in the casino had this weird look in their eyes,” I said, stuttering.</p>

<p>“What the fuck are you talking about?” She pulled on her jeans and walked over to the window, “Christ, you hit an old woman…”</p>

<p>We both stopped talking as we witnessed the spectacle unfolding on the Las Vegas strip below. A police car raced down the strip, swerving in and out of pedestrians who apparently weren’t restricting themselves to the sidewalk. As the car passed through the Tropicana Blvd intersection, several dozen people flung themselves from the overhead walkway and down onto the street. The officer swerved to avoid the falling bodies, jumped the curb and hit the streetlight head-on with his car. Swirls of smoke poured out from under the hood.</p>

<p>Holly gasped at the sight of the collision, but relaxed when the officer opened his door and stumbled out onto the street. Several of the bridge jumpers had risen to their feet and began to slowly make their way towards the officer. Bystanders surrounding the collision also noticed the commotion and also began approaching the scene.</p>

<p>We could see the officer yelling something, then he pulled his revolver and began randomly shooting anyone around him. “What the hell is he doing,” Holly cried as a woman took a shot to the head and crumbled to the pavement.</p>

<p>We couldn’t hear the shots through the closed hotel window, but we assumed he was out of ammunition when he hurled his gun at the crowd. He had only managed to drop the woman, and his barrage did little to effect the crowd’s determination to reach him. The officer fell to his knees as two men grabbed each of his arms…and ripped them from his body. He fell on his face in a heap as the crowd pounced on top of him.</p>

<p>Holly took several steps backward from the window, her eyes wet with tears. She looked at me for some kind of an explanation, but all I could do was turn away from her and look back out the window.</p>

<p>“Kev…what the fuck is going on…did they just kill that cop? Why are people jumping from bridges…why did he shoot those people…” She burst into tears and I grabbed her in my arms.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” I said, “but I think we need to get the fuck out of here.”</p>

<p>After a few minutes, Holly calmed down and I sat on the edge of the bed, racking my brain. There was no way in hell I was going back down to that casino, but as far as I knew, that was the only way back to the ground floor. We wouldn’t have anywhere to go anyway…the valet had our car and keys, and somehow I doubted there was anyone working the valet at that moment.</p>

<p>Holly grabbed the hotel room phone and put the receiver to her ear. She hit a few buttons on the keypad and slammed the phone back in place, “It’s dead. My cell phone!”</p>

<p>She grabbed her purse from the nightstand and dumped its contents onto the bed. As she flipped open her phone, I used the remote to turn on the TV.</p>

<p>“It’s no use…I have service, but it just keeps coming up busy.”</p>

<p>“Holly,” I said, calmly.</p>

<p>“Maybe a text message will work…”</p>

<p>“Holly,” I said, firmly this time. She turned at looked at the TV as I flipped from channel to channel, seeing nothing but static. “We have to get the fuck out of here.”</p>

<p>We both frantically searched our bags for anything we could use in a survival situation. I generally preferred to pack light, so other than several fresh changes of clothes, the only other items in my suitcase were a flask, a lighter, a cigar cutter and my four-inch pocket knife, all of which I jammed into my jean’s pockets. Holly, on the other hand, packed practically two weeks of necessities, in two bags, for a mere weekend trip. Unfortunately her dedication to ‘being prepared’ was useless, since having an outfit for any occasion wouldn’t do much against a rabid mob. The only potentially useful item we found was a can of mace from her purse, which she pocketed.</p>

<p>“Keep trying the cell phone,” I knew where I was headed, I just wasn’t sure what I was going to do once I got there. “Maybe we’ll get a better signal from the roof.”</p>

<p>As we cautiously exited the hotel room, Holly turned left to head toward the elevators.</p>

<p>“Uh-uh,” I signaled her in my direction as I turned to the right, “I think I’ll take the stairs this time.”</p>

<p>Removing my knife from its pocket and opening the blade, I led Holly down the hallway. There were doors on both sides, so I fully expected a bloodthirsty mob to jump out of each one we passed. The hallway was eerily quiet and I got the feeling that we were the only people still on the floor.</p>

<p>The last door at the end of the hallway had an icon of a staircase painted on it, and I paused as I put my hand on the push bar.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong?” Holly inquired upon my hesitation.</p>

<p>“I’m just trying to decide if opening this door is such a great idea.”</p>

<p>“It can’t be any worse than hanging out here in this exposed hallway,” Holly rationalized.</p>

<p>“Good point,” I said as I pushed the door open, baring the pocket knife ahead of me.</p>

<p>The stairwell was well-lit and in good condition, but more importantly, it was empty. I wasn’t sure how far it was to the top of the hotel, but I knew from see the hotel outside, that it was at least twenty stories tall. Luckily, our room was already on the 17th.</p>

<p>Holly closed the door behind her as she entered the stairwell and we both paused for a long moment to listen. Off in the distance we could hear loud thumping and banging. The noises were definitely originating at least several floors below us, but we decided against going down to investigate. We couldn’t hear anything from above our position, so we started to climb.</p>

<p>The staircase leading to the 23rd floor dead-ended at a shut door with sunlight trickling around the edges. Along the push bar of the door was labeled ‘Authorized Personnel Only’, but at this point neither of us were worried about violating hotel policy. I opened the door a crack and peeked through, allowing my eyes to adjust to the sunlight. It was August in the desert, and I could feel the stifling heat pouring through the crack and into the air-conditioned stairwell.</p>

<p>“What’s out there?” Holly asked, trying to look past me.</p>

<p>From this vantage point, I could only see a small portion of the roof, but everything seemed quiet and undisturbed, so I pushed the door open the rest of the way. It swung wide and we both stepped out onto the gravel covered rooftop.</p>

<p>As soon as Holly could get past me, she ran over to the ledge closest to the strip. I cautiously followed after her while surveying the roof for any sign of movement. After deciding the roof was clear, I put my knife back in its pocket and joined Holly at the ledge.</p>

<p>“Look, the cop is gone,” Holly said, pointing at the blood stained asphalt where he fell. “Where did he go?”</p>

<p>I glanced around the street, but didn’t see him anywhere. There’s no way he could have walked away with those injuries. The street was still filled with those insane people, so it’s unlikely an ambulance would have been able to get to him without meeting the same fate.</p>

<p>I suddenly blurted out the only possibility I couldn’t eliminate, “Maybe they ate him?”</p>

<p>Holly snapped her head back and gave me a look as if she couldn’t believe what had just come out of my mouth. Holly’s brother was a police officer back in California, so I think she took my comment personally. Her eyes welled up and she looked back down at the street, ashamed to admit she was thinking the same thing herself.</p>

<p>I put my arm over her shoulder and visually scanned the area surrounding the hotel. The Excalibur, the castle themed hotel across the street, was on fire and smoke was pouring out of broken windows on several floors. The streets were still full of wandering pedestrians and I could now see quite a few abandoned cars further down the strip. McCarran airport was right behind us and was void of activity; highly unusual for one of the highest volume airports on the planet. Something horrible had happened here.</p>

<p>I could also hear screaming in the distance, but I couldn’t tell where it was coming from.</p>

<p>Despite the obvious disaster that had befallen the city, Las Vegas still appeared to be in pretty good shape. Electricity was still functioning properly on almost every casino, and, aside from the smoldering Excalibur, everything appeared normal.</p>

<p>It was the eerie silence that was getting to me. Vegas was always a town hopped up on alcohol, drugs, sex and excitement. Seeing it like this was like looking at it in a painting or a photo. Sure, it looks exactly the same, but you can’t feel the life or energy of actually being in the middle of it. Well, I was certainly in the middle of it and the only life I felt was the one standing next to me on the ledge of the Tropicana’s roof.</p>

<p>A metallic bang startled both of us and we looked back at the roof. The stairwell door slowly swung back and forth in the breeze.</p>

<p>“It’s ok,” I told Holly who was visibly rattled, “it was just the wind.”</p>

<p>A blood stained arm reached out of the shadowed stairwell opening and grabbed the edge of the doorway. A bald, middle aged man with glasses poked his head outside and lazily looked around the roof top. His glasses were askew on his face and his white t-shirt was stained red with blood. He froze when he noticed the two of us standing next to the ledge.</p>

<p>I pulled my knife out and flipped open the blade. We had carelessly left the rooftop door open, giving these monsters full access to our only area of safety. I knew I had to get that door closed before more could make their way through.</p>

<p>Knife in hand, I ran at the man, who growled and mashed his teeth as I approached. When I was close enough to strike, the man grabbed a hold of my free forearm and squeezed it painfully. I reactively brought the knife down into the top of his skull.</p>

<p>His grip on my arm relaxed and he stood there for a moment, as if confused. He then collapsed backward under his own weight, the knife still in his head, and tumbled down the stairwell. On his way down to the next floor, his limp body impacted a group of other blood soaked individuals who were making their way up the stairs. I slammed the rooftop door shut and desperately searched for a way to bar it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the rooftop door had no outer locking mechanism and could easily be opened by a firm push on the door.</p>

<p>“Here!” Holly shouted, handing me a section of metal cable she had pulled from the ground. I wrapped the door handle with the cable and tied it to a thick, steel pipe that ran vertically, just around the corner of the rooftop doorway. I looped it around a few extra times, just to make sure it wouldn’t come loose. As I finished, a force impacted the door. The cable held as the monster inside desperately tried to beat down the door.</p>

<p>After a few minutes, the beating stopped and we decided it must have given up.</p>

<p>“How’s your arm?” Holly asked, reminding me the intense grip the monster had on my arm. There were no cuts or bleeding, but a nasty bruise did seem eminent.</p>

<p>“Oh god, your other arm is bleeding,” Holly gasped.</p>

<p>I examined my right arm. It was completely uninjured, but quite a bit of my attacker’s blood had smeared onto me during the knife assault.</p>

<p>“No, it’s ok…it’s not my blood,” I said as I wiped as much as I could off with my shirt.</p>

<p>“Are you sure you’re ok? That guy looked like he wanted to bite your head off.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, I’m fine,” I assured her, “I’d say he got the worse end of the deal. Anyway, I’m more concerned that we might have just lost our only way off this rooftop.”</p>

<p>“No, I’m pretty sure I saw another stairwell on the far side of the roof,” Holly said, pointing in the distance to another boxy structure emerging from the ground.</p>

<p>“We should go tie that one off too or get the hell off of this roof before it’s too late,” She finished, grabbing another length of cable from the remnants left on the ground.</p>

<p>Not sure which we should do, we began walking towards the other stairwell. Should we dehydrate to death on this roof, under the intense heat of the sun or should we risk getting mauled to death by the occupants of the hotel? Neither seemed a promising choice.</p>

<p>As we approached the second stairwell door, it burst open, and five people stumbled into the sunlight.</p>

<p>“Holy shit, I thought I was going to suffocate in that damn thing,” complained a large, portly man wearing a poker themed shirt.</p>

<p>“We should be able to…freeze!” the second man, in the uniform of a security guard, interrupted himself as he saw us, raising a pistol. As he did so, the other three members of his group, three women in their twenties, screamed and ran back into the stairwell.</p>

<p>We both froze in place with our hands up in front of us. We were more relieved to see normal, talking human beings than fearful of having a gun pointed at us.</p>

<p>“Hang on man, we’re not one of them,” I said, dropping my hands. “We thought we were the only normal people left.”</p>

<p>The security guard relaxed, dropped his pistol and announced, “It’s ok, they’re just more survivors.”</p>

<p>The young women emerged from the doorway and cautiously evaluated us from behind the security guard. One of them had an interesting hat, like a mini-bridal veil, on her head and I assumed they must be in town for a wedding.</p>

<p>“I’m Kevin and this is my girlfriend, Holly,” I said, extending my arm for a hand shake.</p>

<p>“The name’s Martin,” the security guard said, grasping my hand. When he glanced down and noticed the remaining blood on my arm he alarmingly pulled his arm back and re-aimed his weapon. “Where have you been bitten?!”</p>

<p>“It’s not a bite,” I responded, nervously, “I stabbed one of those creatures over at the other stairwell and got his blood all over me.”</p>

<p>Martin lowered the gun and roughly grabbed my arm, carefully inspecting the area for any injuries. Holly had enough, “What the fuck is your problem? Why are you so worried about a bite anyway?”</p>

<p>Martin, apparently satisfied that I wasn’t injured, holstered his gun and answered Holly, “If one of those things bites you, you eventually turn into one of them.”</p>

<p>“That was back when there were six of us,” chimed in the man wearing the poker shirt.</p>

<p>The security guard finished the story for him, “An old man was bitten by his wife and found us down on ten. He was in pretty bad shape. He lasted for about twenty minutes before he finally turned.”</p>

<p>“What are these things?” Holly asked.</p>

<p>Martin shook his head, “I don’t know, but we have to get out of the city. Bullets don’t even put these things down unless you shoot them in the head. Wil here thinks it’s some kind of virus.”</p>

<p>“What else could it be?” said Wil, the man in the poker shirt. “It’s like some kind of brain eating form of rabies or something.”</p>

<p>The three women standing behind Martin were still visibly shaking. Despite the sweltering heat of the rooftop, they were huddled next to each other as if trying to get warm. It didn’t seem like any of them had taken this disaster very well.</p>

<p>One of them finally managed to gather enough courage to yell, “How are we going to get out of here!”</p>

<p>“I’m working on it,” Martin replied, as if annoyed. He leaned closer to Holly and myself and whispered, “I haven’t been able to get any of their names, so far. They’ve kind of just been following me since I shot my way out of the casino.”</p>

<p>He nodded towards Holly, “Maybe she can talk to them…”</p>

<p>Holly accepted and sat the three women against the ledge wall, while Martin, Wil and I secured the stairwell door and discussed our situation. Wil had been in town for a poker tournament at the Rio, but busted out on the first day. His flight was scheduled to leave later tonight and return to San Diego, where he worked in IT consulting. Martin was a Las Vegas resident and the afternoon security manager for the Tropicana. His wife had recently kicked him out of the house, so he had been staying at the hotel. He woke that morning, ready for work, and walked into the same disaster Holly and I had.</p>

<p>“It took me half a clip,” Martin explained, “before I finally dropped one with a head shot. After that I could bring them down in one shot every time. Had to take out half my department just trying to get back to the elevator.”</p>

<p>Hours passed and we made little progress towards a plan on getting us out of the city. The sun has started to set behind the mountains and everyone was getting hungry.</p>

<p>The sun had finally set behind the mountain, but Las Vegas wasn’t a city that dulled at night. Whatever disaster that had befallen the city apparently had no effect on the power grid, as neon and LED lights brightened the strip. Even most of the lights on the Excalibur, which was still smoking from various fires, were lit.</p>

<p>The group sat quietly on the rooftop, unsure of what move to make next.</p>

<p>“So are we going to wait here for help?” said Wil, breaking the silence. “Or are we going to try to get ourselves out of the city. The airport isn’t very far…”</p>

<p>“Do you know how to fly?” asked Martin, the obvious question.</p>

<p>“No,” replied Wil, “but I think I’d still prefer a plane crash to getting eaten alive.”</p>

<p>It wasn’t intended as a joke, but Martin and I couldn’t help bursting out in laughter. Holly, noticing the mood was starting to lighten, waived me over to meet her at the edge of the roof that was out of earshot of the rest of the group.</p>

<p>“So what’s going on?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Wil’s idea is to make a break for the airport and take our chances trying to fly out of here. He hasn’t said so, but I get the feeling Martin wants to wait here for help and I’m inclined to agree. Considering what I’ve seen so far, I don’t know how we’d have a chance of making it to McCarran.”</p>

<p>After a pause, I asked, “What’s with the girls?”</p>

<p>“It took me awhile, but they’ve finally calmed down,” Holly explained, “I guess the three of them are from California, too. Sheri, the one with the bridal hat, is getting married next week and the three of them drove out here for a bachelorette trip. I think it’s a safe bet that they’ll follow whatever the group wants to do.”</p>

<p>“How’s your arm?” Holly added.</p>

<p>“Sore, but I’ll survive,” I said with a smile.</p>

<p>“Please do,” she replied, warmly.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the group met back up near the strip side of the rooftop. Wil was pretty adamant about his plan to make it to the airport, but quickly changed his mind when Martin showed him the two remaining rounds left in his pistol. We were all in agreement that we’d need more than two bullets to make it to McCarran.</p>

<p>“We have an armory down in the security offices,” Martin explained, “but I was barely able to get out of there the last time. There’s enough rifles, shotguns and riot gear down there for a small army, if we could get to it.”</p>

<p>“That’s it,” Wil said, excitedly. “We’ll go down, get the guns and fight our way to the airport.”</p>

<p>“It sounds risky,” I said to Martin, “but I’d say it’s the best plan we have. There isn’t any food or water up here and it’s the middle of summer. We won’t last more than a few more days up here.”</p>

<p>Martin seemed to come around, “Alright, but we’re going to need to come up with something to get into those offices. I’m telling you, the place was crawling with those fuckers.”</p>

<p>The girls seemed nervous about the plan, but everyone eventually agreed that there was no other reasonable option. We decided to make the attempt first thing in the morning after everyone had a chance to rest.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>The peaceful silence of the early morning was broken by the sound of approaching aircraft. The noise jolted me from an uneasy sleep and I wiped the gravel from my clothing as I stood. Martin was already awake and standing at the rooftop ledge, looking into the distance towards the sound.</p>

<p>“It’s a military chopper,” he said calmly as he heard me approach. “It’s sweeping the city like it’s looking for something.”</p>

<p>In the distance, a black helicopter slowly made its way, back and forth, over the city. The rest of the group had awakened and joined us at the ledge. The three girls from the bachelorette party fruitlessly waived their arms in the air, trying to get the chopper’s attention. No one had the heart to tell them they were much too far away to be noticed.</p>

<p>“He’s been making his way towards the center of the city all morning,” said Martin, “he should be right over us within an hour.”</p>

<p>“Thank god,” said one of the three women who all began to excitedly hug each other.</p>

<p>I looked over at Wil, “Looks like you won’t be earning your pilot’s license today.”</p>

<p>Wil nodded and smiled back. He didn’t look disappointed.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>Just as the sun cleared the edge of the eastern mountains, the helicopter began to make its way down the northern end of the strip. As it approached us, we could hear the sound of a muffled loud speaker booming down the corridor created by the hotels. It was almost right above us before we could understand the message it was broadcasting:</p>

<p>“Attention survivors: please rendezvous with rescuers at the rooftop of the Bellagio. The Bellagio has the only rooftop helicopter pad in the city. We will not land at any other point. Make your way to the Bellagio rooftop within 72 hours for airlift rescue.”</p>

<p>The message continuously repeated as the chopper flew past us and continued down the strip.</p>

<p>Martin pulled his pistol from its holster, loaded a bullet into the chamber and said, “Alright everyone, let’s move.”</p>

<p>To be continued…</p>
