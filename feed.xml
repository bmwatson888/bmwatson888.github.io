&lt;p&gt;I sat up in bed and rubbed my eyes. “Ok, I’ll be there,” I said, groggily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guard excitedly slammed the door shut and bounded off down the hall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t the most extravagant inn-room I’ve ever stayed in, but the beds of the Black Oak Inn were far better than the dirt, rock, and twigs I was used to back on the road. The room was small, containing only the bed, a desk with chair, and a cabinet. A window next to the bed provided me an excellent view of the town square, and gave a much more open feeling to an otherwise claustrophobic room. Based on the position of the sun in the sky, I calculated it was mid-day. I’m not a late sleeper by habit, but the added rest was certainly welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reluctantly pulled myself out of bed, got dressed, and opened the cabinet to retrieve my belongings. My pack was just as heavy as I remembered it, though still lighter than normal due to diminishing provisions. I slung the pack over my shoulder, opened the room door, and proceeded down the hallway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The air of excitement was thick as I walked down the stairway into the inn’s tavern. Half a dozen soldiers stood at the bar, all with mugs of ale in their hands, and exuberantly chatted amongst each other. Kreuger sat at a nearby table studying a map of the area and discussing strategy with one of his officers. He looked up and smiled when he noticed my approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sorry to wake you so early,” Krueger said. He nodded towards the soldiers at the bar, “Our missing scouting party has returned…it turns out they weren’t lost or captured.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Good news,” I said. “What happened to them?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The officer standing next to Krueger chimed in, “We were trenched up by the Horde.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Krueger continued, “Conrad, this is Lieutenant Vargas. He led the scouting party.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We found their camp in the glade, just where we thought it would be,” Vargas said while pointing a spot on the map, just south of Windkeep. “We were lucky to get out alive. We weren’t expecting to encounter such a large force, so we spent more time hiding in bushes than marching back to Windkeep. I couldn’t risk getting captured or killed. Our intelligence was vital.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What did you discover?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Their numbers are in the thousands. Armor, weaponry, siege weapons, you name it, they have it,” Vargas said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I thought they were just group of thieves?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s all we’ve seen up until this point,” Krueger explained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vargas let out a sigh, “We think the thieves were really scouts sent to gather supplies and test our defenses. We don’t really have a lot of experience dealing with armies in this region.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Krueger nodded, “Based off Vargas’ information, we believe they are massing a force to launch an assault on Windkeep.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The incredulous look on my face was telling. “For what purpose?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“For financial gain, to establish a foothold in the region, just to terrorize…who knows?” Vargas said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Krueger shook his head. “And I’ve got one hundred fifty city guards and one wizard standing between the people of Windkeep and their utter destruction.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You have to evacuate the city,” I said bluntly. Military tactics and how mages play a part in them was a major field of study for graduating wizards. Along with magic, art, philosophy, chemistry, and engineering, I was well educated in areas of war, so even I knew the town defenses would never hold out. The city walls and an entrenched position would give the soldiers of Windkeep a tactical advantage, but the sheer number of attackers would overwhelm them. A defeat by attrition is still a defeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Where would we evacuate to?” Vargas said. “And if we did evacuate, that would just leave us for slaughter along the road. At least here, in Windkeep, we have the walls to protect us.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I believe the walls will be insufficient,” I said to Krueger. “I say with humility that I am a powerful wizard. I graduated at the top of my class from the Wizard’s Institute, and I have talents and magical abilities most other mages will never elevate to. Even I, however, have my limitations. I can assist your forces, but I cannot win this battle for them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lively atmosphere of the tavern had turned to melancholy, and I realized the scouting party at the bar was listening in on our conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a long look at the men at the bar, and then turned back to Krueger, “I’ll need a spot along the wall, where I have a good view of the battlefield.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;……….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it weren’t for the threat of battle brooding on the horizon, anyone would agree that it was an absolutely beautiful afternoon in Windkeep. The air was warm, with a cool breeze from the north, and the excellent visibility allowed for early detection of the enemy forces approaching over a ridge to the south. Although impossible to see with the naked eye, a magnification spell allowed me to easily see the Horde banners and catapults the moment they popped into view. The main force was still at least an hour away, so Krueger and Vargas were busily preparing for the town’s defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I, on the other hand, stood in the center of the southern wall parapet, mentally preparing myself for the enormous release of magical energy I would inevitably drain from my body. A keen mind and the ability to maintain concentration was vital in spell-casting. A good mage should be able to focus even when completely exhausted. I knew this day would be a testament to my stamina, since casting spells was fundamentally a release of body energy, focused into different patterns. I was more curious than anxious to see how I would fare in such a large scale assault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Do you have everything you need?” Vargas said, as he ran up to stand next to me along the wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We both looked off into the horizon for a moment, and I replied, “Yes, this should be an adequate view for the duration of the battle. I will be deep in concentration for the majority of the battle, so I’d appreciate it if someone could watch my back.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Already taken care of, Conrad,” Vargas said, “Krueger has assigned me as your personal bodyguard. He’ll be stationed at the southeast corner of the wall, directing our forces and watching for possible flanking maneuvers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I assume they’ll attack us in waves to make themselves harder targets for our bowmen and to give the front lines a chance to rest,” I surmised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We assumed that as well,” Vargas said. “We’ll position most of our men along the wall with bow and arrow, and the remainder on standby to replenish fallen men and fill the gaps.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If they breach the wall the battle is over,” I observed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vargas rubbed the back of his head. “Agreed,” he said, as we both turned to look at the threat slowly growing in the distance .&lt;/p&gt;

Despite an unlucky encounter with a couple of thieves, it took me less than a day to cover the thirty miles from the bottom of Mount Baldy to the town of Windkeep, evidence of which I could now see off in the distance. Smoke from several chimneys rose between the trees and the sounds of a bustling thoroughfare began to resonate in my ears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I continued over the crest of the final hill of my journey, and the elevation gave me a spectacular view of the entire city. Dozens of citizens meandered about the streets, which weaved in and out of the houses and buildings. I could tell the marketplace and the town proper was on the side of the city I was approaching, since most of the larger buildings were concentrated in that area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My bag was becoming heavy from a week of continuous travel and the sight of a town guaranteed an evening of creature comforts I’ve long missed. The life of a wandering mage wasn’t a luxurious one, but a hot bath and a soft bed was certainly an effective method of working out the aches and pains of a long journey. It would probably take a day or two before I could arrange for my own cabin, so I was looking forward to treating myself at the local inn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally approached the entrance to the town, where several guards were stationed. They were rough looking and dirty, and both anxiously jumped to attention when they noticed my approach. The older, scruffier-looking guard moved towards me, while the other, younger and appearing much more nervous, discretely lifted his spear. The older guard held his position a short distance in front of me and instinctively moved his hand to the hilt of his sword, still sheathed at his belt. So as not to startle them, I stopped walking and stood silent, waiting for the guards to make the first move. The level of apprehension was unexpected, so I figured it was best to find out more about what was going on before volunteering any information about myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The older guard was first to break the silence, “Who are you and what is your business in Windkeep?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am merely a traveler seeking a room and a meal,” I said as my attention shifted to the younger guard, who was now flanking my position to the right. “And, if at all possible, I’d like to arrange a meeting with your magistrate. I had an encounter on the road, not far from here, with a few thieves.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The road outside of Windkeep is of little concern to the magistrate,” the older guard declared, “since he’s dead.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could see three more guards running up to our position from the village, and I, once again, found myself preparing a defensive spell. This trip had not gone as smoothly as I had hoped. “That is unfortunate to hear,” I sympathized. “What exactly has happened here? My understanding was Windkeep was a peaceful, welcoming village.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guard briefly looked over his shoulder to confirm the arrival of additional guards and then relaxed his hand from his sword, “We were a peaceful village, traveler. Until a group calling themselves the Scarlet Horde moved into the glade, just south of here. The village magistrate was murdered in his sleep two weeks ago by one of their assassins, and they’ve been hitting merchant caravans ever since. It’s likely your thieves were part of that group. I take it your coin purse is much lighter now?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Actually the thieves came to find that I was more than capable of defending myself,” I said as I threw back my traveling cloak to reveal my dark-blue wizard robes. “My name is Conrad and I’ve traveled from the Magical Arts Institute in Belgarath to take up residence here in Windkeep. I believe I can help you with this thief problem.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remaining guards relaxed their armaments and I allowed the spell energy stored in my hand to dissipate back into my body. The older guard approached me with a smile on his face, and reached out, shaking my hand, “Your help will be most appreciated, mage. Windkeep has been under martial rule since the death of the magistrate. I’ll take you to see Kreuger, the captain of the City Guard.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We entered through the city gates as those passing by stopped to take notice of the new arrival. It was clear from their faces that the last few weeks had been tiresome, and I was hoping my arrival wouldn’t muster any false hope. I was only a single mage, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was led through the city square. Now, with a closer view of the buildings, the scars of battle on the town were visible. Broken windows were reinforced with wooden planks, several carts were turned on their sides and strategically placed as barricades, and patrolling guardsmen eyed me suspiciously as we passed by. Citizens were busily bringing in supplies, repairing downed structures, and putting out small fires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s been a rough couple of weeks,” my guide explained as we entered the door of a small building. Above the door hung a carved wooden sign, picturing a dark, lifeless tree surrounded by gold lettering. The sign read: The Black Oak Inn. “The people are worried the town defenses are going to be overrun by the Scarlet Horde. There is talk about abandoning the village. Some have left already.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entering the inn, I could tell the first floor normally served as the local pub, but today it was headquarters to the city defense force. A muscular man with dark hair, thick war armor, and an expensive-looking sword at his belt, stood at the bar. He spoke with several young guards. Based on his tone of authority, my intuition told me this was Krueger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“How long has it been since the scouting party left?” Krueger asked his officer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Two days ago,” the young guard nervously replied. “It was only an eight hour mission at most. They should have reported back yesterday. Shall I organize a search party, Captain?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No,” Krueger paused, noticing my entrance. “They are lost or the Horde found them. Either way, I can’t spare the men. Return to your post and shore up the southern defenses. Dismissed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yes sir,” the guard said grimly as he led the other officers out of the inn. This left Krueger, myself, and my guard escort alone in the inn’s tavern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What have we here, Bigsley?” Krueger asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is Conrad,” the guard explained. “He entered from the eastern gate. Claims to be from Belgarath, sir…from the wizard’s academy?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You’re a mage? Why have you come to Oak Dale?” Krueger investigated. I could tell from his tone that his pessimism was winning the battle against his optimism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“To be honest,” I replied, “I had no knowledge of your current situation. Ironically, I came to Windkeep for the solitude, and the peace and quiet. Ideal conditions for the study of magic.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I can assure you,” Krueger interrupted, “there is no peace here. The Horde attacks randomly, sometimes only to set fires to our village walls and buildings. Our guards have been able to force them back into the woods so far, but our numbers have dwindled over time, and it seems like the Horde’s have been increasing. And I’m sure you’ve heard about the death of our magistrate…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yes,” I said. “Have you requested aid from other provinces?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are so remote, here,” he explained. “Scouting parties never return and convoys are attacked and forced to retreat back into the city. I’m afraid if this goes on much longer, I’ll have to order the evacuation of Windkeep.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a moment to consider my options. I could head back the way I came and leave these people to their own problems, or I could help them fight the Scarlet Horde. When I left Belgarath, I was determined to make Windkeep my home, and if I’ve learned anything about myself over the years, it’s that I don’t get ideas out of my head easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’d like to assist in the fight,” I said abruptly, before I could talk myself out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The addition of a magic wielder to our forces will be a great benefit, Conrad. Welcome to the Windkeep City Guard,” Krueger said with a smile, as he vigorously grabbed my hand and shook it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These people were more desperate than I thought.&lt;/p&gt;

Although visibility will be reduced by the thick foliage of the forest, food and shelter will be in far larger supply than it was back on the trails of the barren mountain. I looked back at the solid mass of rock in disgust. With my supplies nearly gone, it took me just shy of a week to traverse the rocky null which the locals call “Mount Baldy”…and for good reason. The prospect of spending another night choking down stale bread certainly put a spring in my step this morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I continued down the trail and pulled out my map which was sold to me by a street vendor only weeks before. The map was crude and poorly labeled, but the scale of the pathways seemed to be accurate. The vendor had shown me on the map that it would take about six days to scale the mountain. Indeed, in six days I was on the other side. I suppose it was a good deal considering it only set me back two silver pieces, about the cost of a simple dagger. According to the map, the next landmark along this trail is the town, and my planned destination, of Windkeep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Windkeep is supposed to be a sparsely populated, remote location; the perfect home of study for a recently graduated mage. With a small marketplace, Windkeep should be able to keep me supplied with all of the required wizarding components while providing me the room and freedom to perfect my spells. It’s common knowledge in this region that wizards devote years of personal study and reflection to become masters of magic, so the arrival of a nomadic mage should come as no surprise to the people of Windkeep. Heck, they may even be glad to have someone handy with magic around for emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A rustle in the bushes snaps me back from my mental illustrations of Windkeep and I instinctively shove the map back in its pocket to free my hands. Fighters have their broad swords, rogues have their daggers, rangers have their bows, and wizards have their hands. I mentally prepare a defensive spell as a man in leather armor steps out of a bush and into the middle of the path. As soon as he steps out, I begin to size him up: a large wooded staff in one hand, a dagger sheathed on his belt and a ruffled appearance that makes me doubt he’s seen a bath any time recently. I can tell he’s a thief before he even opens his mouth and if that’s the case, there are likely more waiting nearby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hello lonely traveler!” He shouts jubilantly, perhaps some weak attempt to throw me off-guard. “What brings you to travel these parts of Oakdale?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I flex my fingers and stand my ground firmly, his words removing any doubt that this is indeed a robbery. I can feel the warm, tingling power of my defensive spell resonating in my left hand, so I mentally prepare an attack spell with my right. Hopefully there isn’t an army of thieves hiding in the surrounding foliage. I am only one wizard, after all. Once the spell is prepared, I respond to the inquiry, “I’m nothing but an adventurer down on his luck seeking new opportunity in Windkeep. Who wants to know?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew no story I gave would deter these robbers from carrying out their plan, so I hardly devoted any mental resources into formulating a believable story. The thief stared at me hard for a moment and almost seemed taken aback at my pathetic attempt to explain my existence. It almost seemed as if he were reconsidering going through with his plan. Unfortunately though, his greed soon overwhelmed reason and he made his demand, “My name is Jesup, I own this road and you appear to be trespassing. However, fifty silver pieces would certainly be enough to finance your passage through my lands.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as he finished, an arrow thwacked into the ground several feet in front of me. I made sure to make a note of which tree it was shot from. “I assure you that paying the toll will be in your best interest,” the thief said with a smile, as he lifted his wooden staff and began to walk towards me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I have no intention of paying the toll,” I said as I released the energy stored in my left hand. There was a bright flash and my body was surrounded with magical energy. Another arrow whistled through the air and shattered into pieces, mere inches from my chest. My mage shield should hold for several more minutes, but I wasn’t going to give the archer another chance. I raised my right arm, flicked a finger and a small missile of flame shot from my fingertip. The flaming missile impacted within the branches of the targeted tree, which instantly burst into flames. The thief on the pathway, Jesup, turned his attention just in time to see his screaming partner leap from the tree in a ball of fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This distraction was long enough for me to cast a detect spell. As expected, I could suddenly feel the life of Jesup flowing through me and, to a lesser extent, the fading life of his partner who lay motionless at the base of the flaming tree. I couldn’t feel the presence of any other significant life, so I felt confident this was a two-man job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesup, after seeing the flaming debris that was once his partner in crime, briefly turned to look at me and then shot off running into the forest. “Wait, you forgot your silver!” I yelled after him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flames in the tree began to die down and I approached the now deceased archer. Retrieving a vile of blue willow oil from my bag, I poured it onto the body and began to cast a revival spell. Revival spells are known to few wizards and aren’t even taught at the Mage Institution. Luckily I was fortunate enough to befriend one of the professors who taught me extra spells in his spare time. That particular fact is especially lucky for this thief who suddenly sits up, gasping for air. He slowly manages to catch his breath and looks up at me. Recognition flashes across his face and he jumps up screaming and running into the forest half-naked, his tattered, burnt clothing trailing behind him. “Not even a thank you,” I grumble to myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I take note that he runs in the same direction as Jesup, so I postulate there must be an encampment or fort in that direction. I decide I’ll report this incident to the Windkeep magistrate, so they can handle the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The encounter is over as quick as it began and I once again find myself back on the road towards Windkeep.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve had a fungal infection on my small toenail on my right foot for years, and this year I made it one of my goals to take care of it. The issue really had no impact on my life, other than a thick, yellow toenail on my smallest toe. I had genetically inherited the proclivity to catch this kind of nail fungus from my dad, who had major problems with nail fungus all his life. Frankly, I’m lucky I don’t have bigger issues with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the doctor’s recommendation for treatment was to begin a regiment of anti-fungal medication, that I would need to take daily for 12 weeks. The downside? This medication is very hard on the liver, so I would not be able to drink for the entire window of treatment. I surprised myself to find I was kind of excited about the prospect, the excuse &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; to drink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to this, I wouldn’t have called my drinking habits &lt;i&gt;heavy&lt;/i&gt;, but I wouldn’t have called them &lt;i&gt;healthy&lt;/i&gt; either. I’d probably estimate 5-10 drinks per week, on average. Now that I put a number on it, it does seem like a lot. I’d typically have at least one drink a night, and more on the weekends. At least one weekend night, I’d probably have 3-5 drinks. Twelve weeks was certainly the longest period I’ve gone without drinking in the last 20-ish years (since I was 21).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what did I learn over these 12 weeks? Let’s find out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) &lt;strong&gt;It was harder than I thought.&lt;/strong&gt; Drinking is ingrained in our society and some friendships are even based on it. It certainly was a big part of my life, particularly on the weekends. Quite a few of our group activities were literally “to drink”. We’d go wine tasting, bar hopping, or visit breweries. Of course, socializing with friends was the real activity here, but there are healthier ways to accomplish that. I went on a work trip during this period, and during evening get-togethers, attendees would ask me what was wrong with me like I was a terminally ill patient, or shove drinks in my face. Unfortunately, with drinking off the table, time with friends certainly diminished, and when we did get together, my not drinking was a common topic of conversation, as we made plans for the future for my eventual return back to the drinking-world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the habitual side, the first few weeks were difficult, but not oppressive. There were times in the evenings when I’d really crave a beer, or during board game nights when I’d normally always be drinking. For some reason, probably because I’m a masochist, I made sure to challenge myself by leaving the fridge fully stocked with beer (I wouldn’t recommend this for other people though). After 3 weeks or so, the habit went away, and the urge for the evening drink went away. I did still crave a drink (and still do) during board game nights, but I just replaced beer with kombucha or flavored sparkling water, and I was fine. My advice for ending a bad habit would be to replace it with a good habit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) &lt;strong&gt;Drinking has its place.&lt;/strong&gt; Although I eventually came to the conclusion that drinking had too big a place in my life, there certainly is still a place for it. Drinking, on occasion, can strengthen bonds between friends in ways that cannot be done sober. Although drinking is a stress in itself, it can help to relieve stresses in other areas of your life, by allowing you to forget your cares for the night. The danger here, is the addictive nature of constantly needing to forget your cares. If you find you need to constantly drink to be happy, alcohol isn’t for you. You need to seek help, or make other significant changes in your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) &lt;strong&gt;My mood was much more stable.&lt;/strong&gt; After the first few weeks, my mood stabilized quite a bit. The constant highs and lows were gone, and I felt a much more consistent feeling of contentment. I’m not really sure why, but I attribute this to my body chemistry stabilizing from no longer processing alcohol, keeping better hydration, and getting better sleep. Speaking of which…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) &lt;strong&gt;Sleep has noticeably improved.&lt;/strong&gt; I immediately found I was able to sleep through the night easier, and feel more refreshed when waking. Anything more than two drinks, typically meant I would wake in the middle of the night and have trouble going back to sleep. Those days are essentially gone. If you have sleep issues, cut out alcohol and see what happens. Even if you don’t have sleep issues, experiment with a couple weeks without alcohol and see if you notice a difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) &lt;strong&gt;Overall I don’t feel all that different.&lt;/strong&gt; Other than what I’ve previously mentioned, I don’t really feel all that significantly different, both physically and psychologically. I still have my days when I feel great, and occasional days when I feel ‘meh’. In comparison, I feel significantly better after a week of fasting, so for my body, diet is more important than whether or not I drink. When hanging out with friends, I still had fun and never felt like I needed to drink to participate socially. The thought then occurred to me, if I don’t feel that different, why do it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6) &lt;strong&gt;Drinking is expensive.&lt;/strong&gt; Doing a little math, assuming a ball-park of $3 per drink, with an average of eight drinks per week, comes out to a conservatively low number of $100 per month. I bet I spent way more a month than that, since quite often we’d be drinking $8 brewery beers. This one speaks for itself, I gave myself a significant income boost by not drinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, now that I can drink again, what are my habits like today?&lt;/strong&gt; 
It’s been over a month since I’ve completed my medication regiment, and I’ve made some interesting observations. First, I no longer enjoy the taste of beer (as much). I used to love the hoppy IPAs, but now they no longer seem appetizing. However, my tastes have increased significantly for red wine, particularly cabernet. I’m not really sure how to explain this change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, I don’t really enjoy drinking anymore. In social settings, I really got used to having all my wits about me, having a clear mind, and having full control of my physical faculties. After a few drinks, I lose these characteristics, and I take less enjoyment from interactions…as if I’m limited in some way (which I am). Turns out, I like being clear headed. I’m very pleased with this result, as I had feared my return to drinking might result in worse habits than before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I do still drink on occasion, but the amount has significantly reduced. I almost never have more than two drinks on a single day, and that’s once a week at most. If I have 3-4 drinks in a given week, that’s a lot of drinks for me. The daily urge to drink I had previously no longer exists. If you’re concerned about your drinking habits, maybe a break will work for you too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oh, one final note.&lt;/strong&gt; Over the twelve week period, I lost around 10 pounds; however, I did couple this experiment with a calorie reduction, and also switched my diet to Ketogenic, so I can’t firmly conclude ‘not drinking’ was a factor in weight loss. Common sense though, would suggest that it can’t hurt!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Brian Watson</name><email>tenuous.io@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html">I like to look at life’s challenges as opportunities.

Neither is being a miner. Put them together, and you’ve got the most dangerous job this side of Jupiter’s orbit. Can’t really complain about the pay though; I’ll make more living and working here in two years than I could make in fifty back home. Can I even call it home?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been almost twenty-eight months since I first signed up with the Solar Mining Corps, left Earth in a blaze of rocket fuel, and headed for God-knows-somewhere between Mars and Jupiter. This chunk of metal and silicon doesn’t even have a proper name; they just called it Asteroid 20119. Some of the other fellas like to call it ‘Juniper’ after one guy’s ex who was, as he described, ‘a lifeless hunk of uncaring elements, just like this rock’. It’s funny, I couldn’t have described this hell-hole better myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Juniper, there is no room for error, there is no hand-holding, no ‘getting to know you’ period. You either come here tough as nails, or you go home in a body bag. Or worse. I remember one guy, got here about a year ago; his name was Fisher, I think, a real nervous fellow. He lasted about a week before suffering the worst fate a miner can imagine. He was suited-up and working the controls on one of those big hydraulic drills on the far side of the asteroid. There’s no station on that side of the rock, so miners working over there spend nearly ten hours straight in enviro-suits. Well, I guess he was nearing the end of a long shift and it came time to switch out one of his oxygen tanks. That dumb son-of-a-bitch ended up closing the valve to the wrong tank, unlatched the tank he thought was empty, and shot himself into space. You simply don’t understand the energy behind a pressurized tank being emptied into a vacuum in less than a second. And that wasn’t even the worst part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enviro-suited miners are all able to communicate through radio transmitters in their suits. The line is always open, so if you sneeze or fart too loud, everyone on the job site will hear it. For the next ten minutes, every poor sap on the dark side of the asteroid got to experience this fool breathe his last ten minutes of air. Can you imagine: listening to some guy completely lose his shit while suffering from oxygen deprivation, hear the guy beg for help, cry over god-knows what, and then have to go straight back to work. There are no vacation days or psychologists to give you a hug here on Juniper. You can experience the worst shit you’ve seen in your life, and then have go back to your job in complete focus. Tough as nails or you’re dead. As simple as that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I certainly wouldn’t call it easy, but we have it a little better over here on the day side of Juniper. The sun’s radiation is lethal on this side, so it’s impossible to walk on the surface with enviro-suits. I also use the term ‘walk’ loosely. Juniper is about half the size of Earth’s moon, so the gravity here is barely enough to keep us tethered to the surface. The enviro-suits have small stability jets on them that make walking easier, but inside the station, we all fly around like damn super heroes. The station operates a magnetic field that keeps its occupants safe from both radiation and small meteorite impacts. Meteorites are another reason why the life of an asteroid miner is so dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The station’s magnetic field is only capable of repelling anything smaller than a pebble. It doesn’t seem like much, but when that pebble is travelling at ten kilometers a second, it will pass through the station walls, you, the guy next to you, and whatever the hell else gets in its way before burying itself into the surface of Juniper. It’s the big ones we have to worry about. The ones that will hit with so much energy that it will completely obliterate Juniper. I’m not just talking about blowing up the station, I’m talking about rocks that can turn this asteroid to molten soup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily for the residents of Juniper, the asteroid belt is far less dense than most people think it is. Sure there’s a shit-ton of asteroids, millions for sure, but they are stretched out in a ring that’s over three times the length of Earth’s orbit around the sun. There’s so much empty space, we can’t even see any other asteroids from the surface. And let me tell you, looking out one of the station windows is so depressingly lonely, I haven’t looked out one in over a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s where the real danger lies. It’s not the asteroid impacts, drilling accidents, or radiation we have to worry about, it’s the loneliness. There are only about fifty men inhabiting Juniper at any one time, so to us, the entire world consists of only a few dozen people. Believe me though, there’s enough testosterone on Juniper to account for millions. I’m sure you can imagine what happens when you take a group of tough, rock pounders, and lock them up in a tiny space station that’s barely able to support their numbers. Fights do happen, but less often than most people would imagine. No one comes to Juniper to be the big dog on the block, or to prove that they’re the man. We’re all here for one reason only: Money. We are all professional miners, probably the best in the solar system, and we act like it. Most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mental health can sometimes be a real problem on Juniper. When a guy loses his shit, gets lazy, or just plain fucks up, people get killed. Most of the time they just end up killing themselves. But when a miner endangers the life or lives of his fellow workers, that’s when the real fights break out. We’ve got a guy stowed away in an empty storage locker right now for starting up a drill before he had an ‘all clear’ from his team. Luckily no one was killed, but the accident put two miners in the infirmary for almost a month. A station supervisor had to step in and threaten to dock wages to stop the crew from killing the guy. He’ll be headed back home on the next cargo supply for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of which, the quarterly supply ships are the one thing that break up the monotony around here. Every four months we receive a new supply of food, water, oxygen, medicines, drilling materials, goodies, and the like, from home. Basically it’s the bare bones minimum to keep this place functioning, and keep the people in it alive. There isn’t anything on Juniper but minerals and metals (which get loaded into the supply ship for the return trip anyway), so we depend on the supply ships like an umbilical cord. If that cord is ever cut, we don’t make it. Fortunately, the supply ships are quite consistent, and typically load us up with a few extra months worth of supplies, so we’d at least be able to last a little while in an emergency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We haven’t had any major emergencies during my time on Juniper, but we’ve had some close calls. During my eighth month here, one of the supply ships leaving Earth suffered a single engine failure after launch. The ship was still able to make it to Juniper, but its travel time was almost doubled. My understanding is the ship had to make a detour slingshot around Mars just to be able to make it here at all. Things got a little hairy those last few weeks before the ship arrived, when the food ran out, and we were rationed down to two gallons of water per day. The station supervisors offered to cut our work load, but everyone refused. No one wanted to sit in their bunk, staring at the wall, constantly being reminded how hungry they were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our bunks aren’t exactly luxury villas, but at least they offer some private space and quiet time. A miner’s bunk is tiny, about three meters long and wide, and consists of only a bed, a metal cabinet for our clothing and personal effects, and a porthole window about half a meter in diameter. Imagine a prison cell and you’ve got a pretty good picture of my bunk. Bathrooms and showers are in shared facilities down the hall. It took a few weeks to get used to showering in the open with a dozen other guys, but now I hardly notice. It’s rare to ever get the bathroom facilities to myself, but sometimes I get lucky when nature calls in the middle of the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For entertainment (yes, even the toughest bad-ass needs to watch a good flick from time to time), the Corps issues everyone a PMD, or Personal Media Device. The PMD is a small, hand-held, touch-screen device that connects wirelessly to the media servers on the station. From our PMD’s we have access to just about every movie, TV show, or song ever made, can browse through our own pictures we brought from home, or access correspondence as they arrive from Earth. There is even quite a nice library of games. I’m partial to this particular golf game myself. I’ve never played real golf, so after six months of being addicted to the PMD version, I’ve decided to take it up when I get home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The anticipation of returning home certainly began to build when Anderson, my bunk neighbor, noted that I’ll be a passenger on the next supply ship that arrives. In less than two days, I’ll be settling in for a four month journey back to Earth, with an overflowing bank account, and a sunny beach in the Caribbean with my name on it. Preferably a topless beach. Preferably a topless beach filled with gorgeous women. Preferably a topless beach filled with gorgeous, drunk, horny women. If it weren’t for my PMD, I often wonder if I’d even be able to remember what a woman looked like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one on Juniper is particularly close to anyone else (when we aren’t working, we’re either eating or resting), but Anderson has easily been my best friend since he arrived six months ago. I was used to having an empty bunk next to mine (the previous owner is currently floating through the solar system thanks to his carelessness with an oxygen tank), so Anderson’s arrival initially felt like an invasion of my territory. One late evening, about a week after he arrived, I had heard extremely loud music coming through my bunk wall from Anderson’s room. My first reaction was to go kick the snot out of the ‘new guy’, but when I burst through his door, and saw him jumping around the room playing air guitar to a particularly excellent guitar riff coming from his PMD. I couldn’t stop myself from laughing hysterically. Watching this six-foot, muscled, chiseled-jaw, blue eye, blond hair, brute pretending he was a rock star, seemed like the funniest thing I had ever seen in my life. The funniest thing I had ever seen on Juniper, no question. After that level of humiliation, he had no choice but to be my friend. To this day I still make the air guitar motion whenever I want to poke fun at him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was through Anderson that I was introduced classic rock for the first time. After the air guitar incident, I couldn’t get the guitar riff he had been listening to out of my head, so I asked him what it was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You’ve never heard of Jimi Hendrix, man?” was his response. “You’ve gotta be kiddin’ me. He’s only the greatest guitarist to ever live. Ever!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From then on I’ve had a playlist on my PMD singularly devoted to Jimi Hendrix. The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Eric Clapton, all artists previously unknown to me, were now all I listened to. I found it particularly relaxing to listen to ‘Yesterday’ while playing a round of golf on my PMD. Every once in a while, we would get together late in the evening and listen to ‘All Along the Watch Tower’, the song he had been listening to that first night, and the impromptu theme song of our friendship. This time, Jimi had just about gotten to the first solo, when the music abruptly stopped playing, and the station warning claxon began to sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We both alertly looked around the room as if something was about to materialize through the wall, when a computer synthesized female voice began to speak through the station’s speakers, “Automatic quarantine engaged. Stage one lockdown commencing. Please refer to your PMD for further instructions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We both looked down at Anderson’s PMD, and watched the screen change from an image of Hendrix to the orange and black, spider-like biohazard symbol. Anderson tapped the screen with his finger, and began to read the text aloud as it scrolled along the screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--warning&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WARNING&lt;/strong&gt; Due to the detection of an environmental anomaly, station quarantine protocols have been initiated. Please return to your living quarters and remain calm until station supervisors can contain the anomaly. Further information will be forwarded to your PMD when it becomes available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The message just repeats itself after that,” Anderson said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What the hell do they mean by ‘anomaly’,” I said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anderson shrugged, “Who knows. These assholes always like to keep us rough necks in the dark during emergencies. You’ve been here longer than me, when was the last time they locked this place down?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Not once in the two years I’ve been here,” I said. “And I’ve never heard of anyone talk about it either. I didn’t even know a quarantine protocol existed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well, I’m sure it’s nothing to worry about. I’m sure they’ll have it cleared up in a minute.” Anderson picked up his PMD, and fumbled with it for a few moments. “Shit!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What? What’s it say?” I said anxiously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I can’t get this damn biohazard message to clear. Gimmie Jimi you piece of junk!” Anderson said. He hadn’t realized the momentary panic his sudden exclamation caused. I should have known better anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anderson motioned for me to check my own PMD, which I pulled out of my jumpsuit pocket. The orange background with the scrolling black text shone prominently on the screen. Back home, either of us probably would have chucked a stubborn piece of electronics across the room in frustration, but on Juniper, our PMD’s were as important to us as a limb. It was proof of our connection back to Earth; the only thing any of us owned that reminded us that there were better places in the solar system. We both shoved our PMD’s into our pockets, and sat on Anderson’s bed in silence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After about an hour of bitching about the inept station management, and the constant (yet fruitless) checking of our PMD’s for updates, I decided to head back to my room for a nap, hoping that this whole thing would blow over by the time I woke up.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Brian Watson</name><email>tenuous.io@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html">Living in the asteroid belt isn’t exactly a walk in the park.
